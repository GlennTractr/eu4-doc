The **religion** that a nation follows and how tolerant it is of other faiths is an important aspect of gameplay in EUIV. The religion of a nation will confer specific benefits, enable different mechanics, and affect diplomatic actions as nations of mutually accepted religions have a better chance of reaching agreements with one another. Religion is also connected to unrest and provinces of non-tolerated religions are more rebellious. The player has some control over religion by having the option to change the state religion, send missionaries to convert heathen or heretic provinces to the state religion, and carry out religious decisions. In the top left corner of the religion tab, there is a icon of a catholic cross with an arrow, click on that and then you can choose an available religion to convert to. Take over territories of desired religion, let them take some territories and give into their demands of changing the state religion.

[![Religious unity.png](/images/thumb/e/e4/Religious_unity.png/28px-Religious_unity.png)](/Religious_unity "Religious unity") Religious unity is the percentage of a country's development provided by provinces that follow the state religion or a positively tolerated heretic or heathen religion.

In addition:

*   Provinces assigned to [trade companies](/Trade_companies "Trade companies") are not considered when calculating religious unity.
*   Likewise, certain [estate](/Estates "Estates") privileges (“Guaranteed \[estate\] Autonomy”) cause provinces of the relevant religions to be disregarded.
*   Provinces of the state religion always contribute 100% unity regardless of tolerance.
*   Provinces of a heretic or heathen religion contribute a percentage determined by how tolerated they are.

The effects of tolerance on religious unity per province are as follows:

Tolerance

Contribution

< 0

**+0%**

0

**+25%**

1

**+50%**

2

**+75%**

3

**+100%**

For example, suppose a Catholic country has a 10 development Catholic province, a 4 development Protestant province, and a 16 development Sunni province. If heretic tolerance is **+1** and heathen tolerance is **−2**, the country's religious unity will be (100% \* 10 + 50% \* 4 + 0% \* 16) / (10 + 4 + 16) = 40%.

#### Heretic conversion events\[[edit](/index.php?title=Religion&veaction=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Heretic conversion events") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Religion&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Heretic conversion events")\]

_Tolerance of heretics_ of ≥ 2 will allow provinces to randomly convert to those heretic religions. The mean time to happen is 5000 months, lowered by Innovative [Ideas](/Ideas "Ideas") and having a neighboring province with the new religion while increased by having the [theocracy](/Theocracy "Theocracy") government type. Provinces with the "Religious Zeal" modifier will not receive these events at all.

A province is more likely to convert via event to a particular religion if a neighboring province has that religion. Adjacency is not required for most conversions. However, the following conversions _only_ occur if a neighboring province has the new religion:

*   Orthodox ↔ other Christian
*   Buddhist, Shinto → Confucian

In addition, only Japanese-culture provinces can convert to Shinto as the result of an event.

This refers to religions of other religious groups. For example, if the state religion group is Christian, provinces that are of Muslim, Eastern, or Pagan religious groups will use this tolerance value.

The **dominant religion** is the religion with the highest [![Development.png](/images/thumb/a/a4/Development.png/24px-Development.png)](/Development "Development") development in the country. The development of all provinces is considered for this even if they are territories, trade companies, uncored or unfinished colonies. If there are more than two religions in a country, one of them can be dominant even if it has less than 50% of the development (as long as it has more development than each of the other religions). The development of the religions can't be directly seen in the game and has to be calculated from the development of their provinces. The charts page in the ledger **can't** be used to determine the dominant religion, because its percentages are calculated from the number of provinces of a religion and **not** the development.

The dominant religion matters for some events and decisions and for religious rebels. The demands of all non-pagan religious rebels includes the change of the state religion if the religion of the rebels is the dominant religion in the country.

  

Church power\[[edit](/index.php?title=Religion&veaction=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Church power") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Religion&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Church power")\]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Church power is a system used by various Religions to access their special modifiers. Currently, [![Protestantism](/images/thumb/0/0d/Protestant.png/28px-Protestant.png)](/Protestant "Protestant") Protestant, [![Hussite](/images/thumb/2/24/Hussite.png/28px-Hussite.png)](/Hussite "Hussite") Hussite, [![Anglican.png](/images/thumb/6/68/Anglican.png/28px-Anglican.png)](/Anglican "Anglican") Anglican and [![Jewish.png](/images/thumb/c/cd/Jewish.png/28px-Jewish.png)](/Jewish "Jewish") Jewish use Church Power (but its called Faith Power for Jewish nations).  
Church power accumulates over time and can be spend on permanent or temporary modifiers, depending on the respective religion.

Church power formula:

![{\displaystyle {\text{Monthly church power gain}}={\text{Base monarch power}}\cdot 0.10\cdot \left({\text{Other modifiers}}-(1-{\text{Religious unity}})\right)}](https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/png/face9b495ab24ac363702d17cf90a4f7a2f26d91)

*   Religious unity and other modifiers are displayed as percentages in the game. To use them in the formula, convert them to a multiplier, i.e. divide the percentage by 100. (10% is 0.1 for example.)
*   Base monarch power is the amount of monarch power the country gains every month including all bonuses (ruler skills, advisors, power projection bonus, base value).
*   Other modifiers are the sum of modifiers that also affect monthly church power gain:

Additionally, all other countries of the same religion get a **+10** “Defender of Faith” relations boost with the title holder.

Countries automatically call the Defender of the Faith of their religion to arms if attacked by a nation of another religion. Since patch 1.8, it seems the Defender of the Faith gets a call to arms only for countries on the same continent or sharing their border. The Defender of the Faith doesn't get a call to arms if the country attacked is a co-belligerent (e.g., if France is the Catholic Defender of the Faith and Venice (Catholic) is allied with Serbia (Orthodox), then if Ottomans (Sunni) attack Serbia and make Venice co-belligerent, France doesn't get a call to arms).

If the defender of the faith has the [Religious idea](/Religious_ideas "Religious ideas") _“Deus Vult”_, they have access to the [Defender of the Faith casus belli](/Casus_belli#Defender_of_the_Faith "Casus belli"). This CB is used to attack a country of a different religion that is at war with a second country of the same religion. It doesn't matter whether the triggering war is offensive or defensive, what its CB is, or whether the target is a primary or secondary participant (but for primary defenders normally the defender of the faith will have received a call to arms instead). The targeted country doesn't join the war (in part because they are already at war with the defender), nor do they grant conditional military access. Ticking warscore comes from winning decisive battles.

Catholic countries that hold the Defender of the Faith title cannot be excommunicated by the Papacy, regardless of relations.

The Defender of the Faith loses the title, but not any prestige, if they lose any war. However, declining a call to arms will cause **−20** trust with **all** countries of the same religion as the Defender of the Faith, so it is especially dangerous to refuse protect countries because your same religion allies can break alliance with you making you vulnerable. Additionally declining the call to arms will cause you to suffer the same penalties as if you decline the defensive call to arms from your ally. An additional penalty lasting for 1800 days (roughly 5 years) for declining is a **−2** point hit to diplomatic reputation: **−1** from "Dishonorable Defender of the Faith" and **−1** from "Dishonored Alliance" (this last penalty will occur whether allied or not to the same religion defender).

If Defender of the Faith refuses a call to war, it gets a 5-years truce with the country that was calling. Therefore, if your ally is Defender of the Faith and you have a common enemy of the "defended" religion, this ally will not be able to join you in an offensive war against this enemy, as AI wouldn't break a truce.

**Note:** If the title holder ends any war with a result other than a white peace or victory, the title will be lost.

### Province conversion\[[edit](/index.php?title=Religion&veaction=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Province conversion") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Religion&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Province conversion")\]

The most common way to convert provinces is the use of missionaries, but there are also several other methods.

####  [![Missionaries.png](/images/thumb/a/ad/Missionaries.png/28px-Missionaries.png)](/Missionary "Missionary") Missionaries\[[edit](/index.php?title=Religion&veaction=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Missionaries") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Religion&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Missionaries")\]

Missionaries are [envoys](/Envoys "Envoys") that can convert a province to a nation's official religion. Missionaries slowly convert provinces over time: each month, the effective missionary strength in that province is added as ongoing progress, and when it reaches 100% the province is converted. If strength is insufficient (less than 0%), the province will never convert (although the missionary will not lose progress). An active missionary in a province will increase the [unrest](/Unrest "Unrest") there by **+6%**.[\[7\]](#cite_note-7)

##### Missionary maintenance\[[edit](/index.php?title=Religion&veaction=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Missionary maintenance") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Religion&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Missionary maintenance")\]

The player can adjust the missionary maintenance cost by a slider on the [economy interface](/Economy "Economy") between zero and full funding. Reducing the funding reduces missionary strength linearly, up to **−100%** [missionary strength](/Missionary_strength "Missionary strength") without funding. At full funding the costs of an active missionary per month is calculated based on the [development](/Development "Development") and [local autonomy](/Local_autonomy "Local autonomy") of the province as follows[\[9\]](#cite_note-9):

![{\displaystyle {\text{Monthly cost}}={\frac {0.5\times {\text{province development}}^{\left(1+{\text{autonomy}}\times 0.75\right)}\times (1+0.005\times ({\text{year}}-1444))}{12}}}](https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/png/53d463242422f29c0537377a794209e2acad09bd)

The province development is capped at 30 [\[10\]](#cite_note-10)

The first three European nations to convert to [![Protestantism](/images/thumb/0/0d/Protestant.png/28px-Protestant.png)](/Protestant "Protestant") Protestant, the first three to convert to [![Reformed.png](/images/thumb/3/3e/Reformed.png/28px-Reformed.png)](/Reformed "Reformed") Reformed, Bohemia if the [![Hussite](/images/thumb/2/24/Hussite.png/28px-Hussite.png)](/Hussite "Hussite") Hussite religion is chosen, and a British nation if it takes one of the appropriate choices to convert to [![Anglican.png](/images/thumb/6/68/Anglican.png/28px-Anglican.png)](/Anglican "Anglican") Anglicanism, have a random European province designated as a [![Center of reformation.png](/images/thumb/e/e4/Center_of_reformation.png/28px-Center_of_reformation.png)](/Center_of_reformation "Center of reformation") Center of Reformation. These centers of reformation will automatically convert nearby provinces to their religion. Provinces converted by a center of reformation get the **−100%** religious zeal modifier to missionary strength in that province for 30 years. Missionaries can't work in the same province that is being converted by a center of reformation. Each center of reformation can only convert one province at a time. Players will receive a notification if all provinces within the center's range have been converted to its religion.

##### Destroying centers of reformation\[[edit](/index.php?title=Religion&veaction=edit&section=20 "Edit section: Destroying centers of reformation") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Religion&action=edit&section=20 "Edit section: Destroying centers of reformation")\]

When playing as the Holy Roman Emperor, one may wish to destroy the centers of reformation in order to stop the spread of automatic religious conversion before religious disunity is able to drain too much imperial authority.

A center of reformation is destroyed if its province is converted to another religion. One method for a [![Catholicism](/images/thumb/3/39/Catholic.png/28px-Catholic.png)](/Catholic "Catholic") Catholic nation to slow or stop the spread of the reformation is to conquer and convert a province with a center of reformation, thereby eliminating its missionary effect on neighboring provinces. Forcing religion through a peace deal on a country with a center of reformation on its capital will immediately convert the province, destroying the center of reformation in the process. If the center of reformation is not in the nation's capital province, ceding every other province to yourself or to other nations in a peace deal will force the defeated nation's capital to move to the province with the center of reformation, letting you destroy it if you also demand "force religion" in the same peace deal.

A center of reformation will cease to convert provinces after start of the [![Age of Absolutism.png](/images/thumb/e/ec/Age_of_Absolutism.png/28px-Age_of_Absolutism.png)](/Age_of_Absolutism "Age of Absolutism") [Age of Absolutism](/Age_of_Absolutism "Age of Absolutism").

#### Conversion using trade policy\[[edit](/index.php?title=Religion&veaction=edit&section=21 "Edit section: Conversion using trade policy") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Religion&action=edit&section=21 "Edit section: Conversion using trade policy")\]

Muslim nations can enable "Propagate religion" policy in trade nodes inside a [trade company region](/Trade_company "Trade company"), provided that they control at least 50% of trade power in this node. While this policy is active, it will work the same way as a [![Center of reformation.png](/images/thumb/e/e4/Center_of_reformation.png/28px-Center_of_reformation.png)](/Center_of_reformation "Center of reformation")center of reformation, but it will only target provinces which have a non-abrahamic religion.

Colonies will convert to their owner's religion and culture in certain circumstances, most requiring the involvement of a colonist. See [Colonization § Colonial provinces](/Colonization#Colonial_provinces "Colonization") for details.

### National conversion\[[edit](/index.php?title=Religion&veaction=edit&section=23 "Edit section: National conversion") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Religion&action=edit&section=23 "Edit section: National conversion")\]

There are several different ways a country may change religion.

#### By direct action\[[edit](/index.php?title=Religion&veaction=edit&section=24 "Edit section: By direct action") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Religion&action=edit&section=24 "Edit section: By direct action")\]

Some religions may convert among certain heresies/sects via the Religion panel, at a cost of 100 prestige. This can only be done once every 10 years. This is true for Catholic, Protestant and Reformed Christians, Hindus and Sikhs once Sikhism is unlocked, as well as all Buddhists. Conversion by this method will give **+10%** [![Missionary strength.png](/images/thumb/3/31/Missionary_strength.png/24px-Missionary_strength.png)](/File:Missionary_strength.png) missionary strength against [heretics](/Heretic "Heretic") for ten years, making conversion of provinces of the old faith quite rapid. Sikhs can also convert to Sunni or Shia Islam this way. Defenders of the Faith cannot convert religions through this method.

Conversion is also possible through decisions in some cases, which causes a -4 stability hit (except for Sikh or Sunni/Shia conversion, which only reduces it by 2). With the [Star and Crescent](/Star_and_Crescent "Star and Crescent") DLC, Sunni and Shiite (but not Ibadi) Muslims may convert to the other denomination if both their capital and the majority of their province development follows the other denomination.

Without [![Mandate of Heaven.png](/images/thumb/7/7c/Mandate_of_Heaven.png/28px-Mandate_of_Heaven.png)](/Mandate_of_Heaven "Mandate of Heaven") Mandate of Heaven, Japanese [daimyos](/Daimyo "Daimyo"), but not the Shogun or Japan itself, may convert to Catholicism by decision if the majority of their territories are Catholic, which can happen following certain events in the 16th century. With Mandate of Heaven, the Open outcome for the Ikko - Ikki, Neo-Confucianism, and Spread of Christianity Incidents will unlock a decision to convert to Mahayana, Confucianism, and Catholic respectively.

Pagan nations that are not Tengri may convert to any non-Pagan faith if they control even just one province of that faith (they do not require a majority of that faith to convert and can immediately accept religious rebel demands to convert); Tengri nations are limited to Vajrayana Buddhism.

Muslims owning a Sikh province may decide to convert to Sikhism - this decision probably mostly exists to allow Punjab to easily follow its historical religion.

If using rebels to convert (see the section below) be aware that newly acquired provinces will suffer separatism that will spawn separatists instead of religious rebels if being converted by a missionary on low maintenance. To avoid this make sure the new province only has the player's core on it, or that rebel progress is below 30% (hence 20% or lower) in which case the rebels will change from separatists to religious rebels.

#### By event\[[edit](/index.php?title=Religion&veaction=edit&section=25 "Edit section: By event") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Religion&action=edit&section=25 "Edit section: By event")\]

[![Totemism](/images/thumb/3/33/Totemism.png/28px-Totemism.png)](/Totemist "Totemist") Totemist and [![Animism](/images/thumb/1/18/Animist.png/28px-Animist.png)](/Animist "Animist") Animist pagans get events to convert to [![Catholicism](/images/thumb/3/39/Catholic.png/28px-Catholic.png)](/Catholic "Catholic") Catholic, [![Protestantism](/images/thumb/0/0d/Protestant.png/28px-Protestant.png)](/Protestant "Protestant") Protestant, or [![Reformed.png](/images/thumb/3/3e/Reformed.png/28px-Reformed.png)](/Reformed "Reformed") Reformed Christianity if they have neighbors of the appropriate denomination and a sufficient **positive** opinion with that neighbor. Tengri pagans with a dominant secondary faith may be prompted to change to it or face a -3 stability hit; they also have event chains that end in conversion to their secondary religion.

 [![Flag of Kongo](/images/thumb/1/16/Kongo.png/20px-Kongo.png)](/Kongo "Kongo") [Kongo](/Kongo "Kongo") and [![Flag of Ming](/images/thumb/a/a5/Ming.png/20px-Ming.png)](/Ming "Ming") [Ming](/Ming "Ming") have special event chains to convert to [![Catholicism](/images/thumb/3/39/Catholic.png/28px-Catholic.png)](/Catholic "Catholic") Catholicism.

A nation in the British region, typically [![Flag of England](/images/thumb/2/21/England.png/20px-England.png)](/England "England") [England](/England "England"), can get an event, based on the wives of Henry VIII, to convert to [![Anglican.png](/images/thumb/6/68/Anglican.png/28px-Anglican.png)](/Anglican "Anglican") Anglicanism with the [![Rule Britannia.png](/images/thumb/5/5a/Rule_Britannia.png/28px-Rule_Britannia.png)](/Rule_Britannia "Rule Britannia")Rule Britannia DLC.

Some nations, for example [![Flag of Sweden](/images/thumb/9/98/Sweden.png/20px-Sweden.png)](/Sweden "Sweden") [Sweden](/Sweden "Sweden"), have unique events enabling them to change religion.

Countries that have the Indian Sultanate government by default, but are neither Muslim nor were forcefully converted to another religion, will quickly be forced to choose by event between conversion to the appropriate branch of Islam, or facing a large amount of rebels and a stability hit. This generally only is the case if they have been released as a vassal or in a peace deal, which will likely make them Hindu initially, because Indian sultanates rarely convert the local religion, and indeed have no need to due to their large bonus to heathen tolerance. AI will always choose to convert.

Please help with verifying or updating this section. It was last verified for [version](/Europa_Universalis_4_Wiki:Versioning "Europa Universalis 4 Wiki:Versioning") 1.31.5.

A nation can force a heretic country (hence only one in the same denominational group) to change their state religion as part of a peace deal. This will have the same base war score cost as annexing the nation. An appropriate [casus belli](/Casus_belli "Casus belli") such as "Cleansing of Heresy" or "Religious Conformance" (unique to the [Holy Roman Emperor](/Holy_Roman_Emperor "Holy Roman Emperor") against HRE members) will lower the cost significantly. There are some ideas, government reforms and other boni that can reduce the cost further.

The Theocratic Government Reform "Global Crusade" unlocks the Casus Belli "Great Holy War" against neighbouring heathens and heathens with a claimed province. This Casus Belli allows the conversion of heathen nations in addition to lowering the cost of the peace option. Completing the Exploration Ideas or having the Tier 2 Government Reform "Mission to Civilize" will unlock it against heathens in the Pagan Religious Group. Unlocking the Idea "Deus Vult" will unlock it against any heathen. Nations converted by a Theocracy with "Global Cursade" will also receive [![Missionaries.png](/images/thumb/a/ad/Missionaries.png/28px-Missionaries.png)](/Missionary "Missionary") **+1** Missionary, [![Missionary strength.png](/images/thumb/3/31/Missionary_strength.png/28px-Missionary_strength.png)](/Missionary_strength "Missionary strength") **+3%** Missionary strength, [![Religious unity.png](/images/thumb/e/e4/Religious_unity.png/28px-Religious_unity.png)](/Religious_unity "Religious unity") **+50%** Religious unity and [![Missionary maintenance cost.png](/images/thumb/6/61/Missionary_maintenance_cost.png/28px-Missionary_maintenance_cost.png)](/Missionary_maintenance_cost "Missionary maintenance cost") **−100%** Missionary maintenance for 10 years.

Note that when a country is converted through force religion, only the state religion and the capital province's religion change (if the current capital is taken in the piece deal the new capital will be converted). Therefore it is common that bigger nations will eventually revert back to their original religion if able (or be forced by religious rebels if not) since the majority development of their provinces is not that of this new forced religion.

  
It is also possible to change the Religion of another nation without war.

With the [![Common Sense.png](/images/thumb/e/e4/Common_Sense.png/28px-Common_Sense.png)](/Common_Sense "Common Sense")[Common Sense](/Common_Sense "Common Sense") DLC, using the subject interaction screen, the player can force their subject nations to change religions if they follow a different faith. This requires the subject to have a positive opinion of its overlord and less than 50% liberty desire. Such a forced conversion will result in **+50%** [liberty desire](/Liberty_desire "Liberty desire") if heretic (hence in the same denominational group), and if heathen **+100** [liberty desire](/Liberty_desire "Liberty desire"), both gradually ticking down over a very long time.

Once the religion of the [Holy Roman Empire](/Holy_Roman_Empire "Holy Roman Empire") has been locked, the emperor can also request a prince to change their state religion depending on their opinion of the Emperor. Similarly to when forcing a religion of an enemy country, the prince has its capital converted while the rest of the provinces remained unaffected.

Changing the religion of other nations can have significant strategic implications that will materially affect game play, for example:

*   It can help the player quickly reach higher levels of benefits if they are the Defender of the Faith
*   It can help the player ally such nations easier in the future as they "share the same religion" or have them get lower aggressive expansion against the player while they gobble up neighbouring "heretic" nations.
*   \[More advanced methods\] This same method can be used "in reverse" by the player to be converted by another AI heathen nation (hence in the same denominational group). To do this the player should get to a 100% war score against the enemy AI by sieging all their provinces. Then, instead of demanding something from the AI enemy, the player in facts offers to the enemy (as though it has lost the war) that the player itself be converted. Hence, for example, the player being an Animist Ryuku could "offer" to the AI Nahuatl enemy to be force converted into Nahuatl, which is in the same Pagan denominational group. Be sure that the player's overall country size must be less than 100% war score to be converted this way by the AI. Note that primitive nations cannot do such "reverse" force conversions until they are reformed.
*   \[More advanced methods\] In multiplayer games a Catholic player can for example gain an Orthodox province nearby from which they can spawn religious rebels and be converted. To do this the player needs to have an Orthodox human ally force convert say a neighbouring AI One Province Minor (OPM) within Catholic Europe with whom the player is at war. To do so both the player and the ally need to fight together in the war with the OPM. Once the player has sieged the capital of the OPM they can then as the war leader transfer control of that province to the ally. The ally would then be able to separate peace the OPM during which they will force convert them to being Orthodox. The player can then re-siege the OPM and annex them fully. The player would then have an Orthodox province from which they can spawn religious rebels to convert the country (see conversion by rebels further below).

#### Forced conversion by rebels\[[edit](/index.php?title=Religion&veaction=edit&section=27 "Edit section: Forced conversion by rebels") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Religion&action=edit&section=27 "Edit section: Forced conversion by rebels")\]

Nations can [support religious zealots](/Support_rebels "Support rebels") in other countries. These rebels convert a province's religion to the one they represent when occupation is achieved.

Supporting religious zealots is only possible if the desired religion is present in the target nation and is the likely rebel type in a province with unrest above 0. If there are no such provinces in the target nation, one way to achieve it is to sell the target a province of the correct religion.

Generally the nation will be able to overpower the rebels if left to its own devices, so it is critical to support them militarily. This can be done by declaring war against the target nation using the "Support Rebels" [casus belli](/Casus_belli "Casus belli").

A nation that is broken by religious rebels, or that accepts their demands, will convert to the rebels' religion provided that the rebels' religion is the plurality[\[12\]](#cite_note-12) religion in terms of **development** (the autonomy of the provinces or the number of provinces do **not** matter). For most countries, giving in to religious rebels is the only way to change between religious groups.

Starting with version 1.34, rebels of any [pagan](/Pagan "Pagan") faith except Nahuatl, Mayan and Inti can convert a tag of any faith to their own through enforcing their demands (their demands cannot be accepted as a non-pagan nation); formerly this was only possible for [![Animism](/images/thumb/1/18/Animist.png/28px-Animist.png)](/Animist "Animist") Animist rebels.

To trigger a religious rebel revolt and be forcefully converted by rebels the following steps are suggested:

*   The player must ensure they own at least one province of the targeted religion and that the province has unrest (provinces in which there has recently been a revolt will have a -100% modifier, and will not be suitable).
*   The player should reduce their missionary maintenance to zero and then send a missionary to the targeted province to try and convert it. At zero maintenance the province will never be converted and simply cause additional unrest.
*   This should trigger religious rebels with a ticking progress meter.
    *   If using rebels to convert be aware that newly acquired provinces will suffer separatism that will spawn separatists instead of religious rebels if being converted by a missionary on low maintenance. To avoid this make sure the new province only has the player's core on it, or that rebel progress is below 30% (hence 20% or lower) in which case the rebels should change from separatists to religious rebels.
*   In the rebel interaction menu the player can then "provoke rebels" once the progress meter has reached 50%; this will spawn rebels at **+50%** strength.
*   Once the rebels have spawned they will start converting provinces unprotected by forts (hence be sure to mothball forts before they spawn).
*   Once the plurality of religion is of the new type the player can then accept their demands and be converted.
*   Be aware that rebels can break a country prematurely if they control more than 50% of the country or have controlled the capital for a while (typically 24 months). However, rebels cannot enforce their demand during war (unless they somehow manage to convert 100% of all provinces, or they have controlled the capital for 24 months). So it may be advisable to be at war while these rebels are converting as much of the country as possible. These rebels are fragile though and need to be "protected" while converting.
    *   The player should therefore set vassals to "snooze" in their own territories and not allow allies or other armies engaged in war to have access in the player's country so as to accidentally engage the rebels.
    *   Also, uneven and untidy borders and straits blocked by ships may cause rebels to walk through neighbouring countries and be killed there.
*   If they are killed, re-siege one of the newly converted provinces (ones without the -100% recent uprising modifier) to again try and convert it and respawning the rebels.
*   Know that if one is not at war while the rebels are busy moving about one's country it will become a fine balance between (i) unsieging rebel-controlled provinces to avoid their premature enforcement of demands (before the 50% requirement is met) or triggering "rebels break the country" and (ii) not impeding their progress.
*   Be considerate that they are very likely to re-siege the same provinces or to attack one in order to keep provinces under their control.
*   Sadly there is no easy method to determine the plurality of a religion as the rebels progress, except for watching the "Accept rebel demands" to see when it changes to "X becomes the new state religion of Y". A rough guide to track the religious progress towards being the plurality of the religion is to use the "Charts" panel in the ledger (panel 35) under the Economy Section in the ledger. However, the charts are merely a proxy as they only show the _number_ of provinces that have the particular religion and sadly is _not weighted by development_. An alternative method would be to check the religious unity in the religion tab although this is also flawed as the weighting is heavily affected by the nation's tolerance to heathens and heretics.

With some luck and God's will these rebels may be successful in their quest to convert the majority of the country and the player can soon enjoy following the path of this new accepted faith.

![Strategy](/images/thumb/a/a2/Years_of_separatism.png/36px-Years_of_separatism.png "Strategy") _The below is **one of many** player suggested strategies for **Religion**. Bear in mind, due to the dynamic nature of the game, it may unfold differently for other players._

*   Base missionary strength is very small compared to modifiers, both positive and negative. This means that conversion can be very fast or impossible. [Religious ideas](/Religious_ideas "Religious ideas") are sometimes essential to make any progressive conversion work.
*   Setting provinces as [states](/States "States") is vitally important:
    *   Provinces in territories and with an unaccepted population culture have a missionary strength modifier of **\-4%** before other modifiers. In contrast, provinces in states can promote cultures to become acceptable and can further enact "Enforce Religious Unity" for a modifier of **+1%**, a net overall difference of **+5%** in such accepted culture enforce religious unity provinces.
*   Provinces that do not have the state religion generally suffer from low tolerance and also lower the nation's Religious Unity. With that, nations that are challenged with large numbers of wrong-religion provinces will have to choose between converting them or tolerating them, and with the 1.26 update the main way of tolerating them as a large nation is to use the Humanist [idea group](/Idea_group "Idea group").
*   Note that only provinces with the the state religion and no separatism can be culture converted.
*   Several Triggers for Religions give bonuses or penalties. You should keep in mind these Triggers to optimize your religious conversion. See [Triggered modifiers](/Triggered_modifiers "Triggered modifiers").
*   In high development provinces building a cathedral will add **+3%** local missionary strength, helping with the conversion as well as additional tax revenue.
*   For Catholic nations intending to convert to Protestant or Reformed, consider driving relations with the Pope down to enact _Declare Statute in Restraint of Appeals_ and then build them back up to _Revoke Restraint of Appeals_ for a **+1%** missionary strength that remains to the end of the game.
