The Principalities of Wallachia and [![Flag of Moldavia](/images/thumb/5/59/Moldavia.png/20px-Moldavia.png)](/Moldavia "Moldavia") [Moldavia](/Moldavia "Moldavia") are nested between powers much greater than themselves. Thus far they have survived by playing the dangerous game of offering fealty to whichever nation they believe most likely to protect them against the others. A Voivode who wishes to thrive must carefully observe the balance of power.

The Voivodes had long been members of the Order of the Dragon, a noble and knightly order dedicated to defending Christendom from the encroaching [![Flag of Ottomans](/images/thumb/8/89/Ottomans.png/20px-Ottomans.png)](/Ottomans "Ottomans") [Ottoman Empire](/Ottomans "Ottomans"). It was no surprise when the Principalities answered the call for the Crusade of Varna. This grand military coalition aimed to drive the Turks from the Balkans and restore Christian rule. The Crusade, however, was a devastating failure, leaving kingdoms broken and the future of the region insecure.

In the immediate aftermath of the Crusade a diplomatic incident led to the [![Flag of Hungary](/images/thumb/6/6a/Hungary.png/20px-Hungary.png)](/Hungary "Hungary") [Hungarian](/Hungary "Hungary") general Hunyadi being imprisoned by Vlad II of Wallachia. Though the situation was resolved without further conflict, relations have soured enough that Wallachia should not count on Hungarian aid for the time being.

The Voivode of Wallachia joined the Crusade in spite of his son Vlad Dracula being an Ottoman captive; unsurprisingly he now believes that his son must have been slain by Turkish hands. Unbeknownst to the Voivode an embittered Vlad was spared by the Sultan and lives in exile, plotting his revenge against Turk and Wallachian alike.

Uncertainty grips Moldavia also; the former monarch Ilias I has died in exile in [![Flag of Poland](/images/thumb/9/99/Poland.png/20px-Poland.png)](/Poland "Poland") [Poland](/Poland "Poland"), leaving his son Roman as a potential claimant to the throne. Roman has secured nominal Polish support for his claim, pledging eternal Moldavian fealty should he become Voivode. It is only a matter of time before Roman attempts to seize the throne from his uncle Stefan.

**Wallachia** is a nation in eastern Europe. It is bordered to the North by [![Flag of Hungary](/images/thumb/6/6a/Hungary.png/20px-Hungary.png)](/Hungary "Hungary") [Hungary](/Hungary "Hungary"), to the North-East by [![Flag of Moldavia](/images/thumb/5/59/Moldavia.png/20px-Moldavia.png)](/Moldavia "Moldavia") [Moldavia](/Moldavia "Moldavia") and to the West and the South by the [![Flag of Ottomans](/images/thumb/8/89/Ottomans.png/20px-Ottomans.png)](/Ottomans "Ottomans") [Ottomans](/Ottomans "Ottomans"). Its holding are decent when it comes to development, and further development and advancement in Institutions are available due to the flat terrain in its provinces. Wallachia and [![Flag of Moldavia](/images/thumb/5/59/Moldavia.png/20px-Moldavia.png)](/Moldavia "Moldavia") [Moldavia](/Moldavia "Moldavia") are the only two countries that can form [![Flag of Romania](/images/thumb/8/8f/Romania.png/20px-Romania.png)](/Romania "Romania") [Romania](/Romania "Romania") without requiring a culture shift. It has access to the Romanian missions, together with Moldavia.

![Strategy](/images/thumb/a/a2/Years_of_separatism.png/36px-Years_of_separatism.png "Strategy") _The below is **one of many** player suggested strategies for **Wallachia**. Bear in mind, due to the dynamic nature of the game, it may unfold differently for other players._

In 1444 Wallachia is poised between the three powerful nations of Poland, Hungary, and the Ottomans, and it cannot rely on any of them for long term protection. Wallachia is landlocked and the possibilities to expand are limited. The largest issue facing the nation is its lack of prospective allies. The economy of Wallachia is also quite weak. The current heir, Mircea Basarab, is horrible, but this is something that the player can ignore, as a scripted event can seat Vlad Dracula (the historical basis of the "Dracula" legend) as its ruler once Vlad II, the current ruler, dies. Vlad Dracula is much better than Mircea Basarab. In order to meet the challenge of playing Wallachia, the player must be aggressive by growing quickly, securing good alliances, and getting protection against its neighbors. At 1444 Wallachia has a truce with the Ottomans, giving it ample time to grow, but this truce will also prevent Wallachia from attacking the Ottomans early, if such an opportunity arises.

**Opening moves:**

\- Day 1: Secure a Royal Marriage with Hungary, build infantry up to your force limit, and get a general with at least 1 pip in siege (convert you heir, or recruit a general). Start to improve relations with your first alliance target or with Ottomans. The first alliance target will be discussed later. Set both Moldavia and Serbia as your rivals. Send your merchant to collect in Constantinople (this is better than sending him to steer trade upstream), and Mothball your forts.

\- As soon as you've built to force limit, gather them near the Moldavian border. Assign your siege general to a single infantry unit. The first mission can be completed too (recruited to force limit) for some minor military bonuses, but it is not necessary. Check who is the ally of Moldavia. Most of the time, it will be Circassia, this being the ideal option. Imereti can work too. Byzantium can work under certain conditions (hence if the player is very good at warfare and/or can secure military access from Ottomans), but not ideal. In case of other alliances, simply restart. Give Giurgiu to Clergy, then "Seek support of the Clergy". Then "Demand Administrative support," which will give 100 Admin points. Clergy loyalty should remain high enough to retain a reduced stability cost bonus. Now, declare a no CB war on Moldavia and use the administrative points to cover the stability loss.

\- Move the whole army to Bessarabia. The fort shouldn't be fully reinforced. Moldavia will bring its army to occupy your mothballed forts. Intercept them with the ruler/main army, leaving the one infantry with the siege general in Bessarabia (preventing the fort from being supplied). The main army shall be enough for a stack wipe, but if not, take care to intercept any further incursions, however this will slow down the siege.

\- As soon as the diplomat is back, improve relations in Lithuania and Crimea, just to be able to get military access. However, don't request it before Moldavia is peaced out, that way Circassia can not come to help Moldavia as they will sometimes land troops in Bessarabia. Although they can be defeated, it will drain much needed resources from the treasury and manpower pool, and is thus best to be avoided.

\- As soon as the siege of Bessarabia is done, carpet siege Moldavia, moving a siege stack to Suceava. Exercise caution, there may be a small Moldavian army lurking nearby.

\- Separate piece shall be signed with Moldavia, as soon as Bessarabia and Birlad can be claimed. The timing is critical, because Moldavia will get an event that will make them a vassal of Poland or Hungary, and then the war is over. This is why the 1 siege pipe is necessary for the general. Without that, the siege of Bessarabia can not be finished before the event.

\- Once Moldavia is peaced out, get military access through Lithuania and Crimea, the objective being to attack Circassia. If the ally of Moldavia was Imereti, military access is needed also from Circassia, and this depends on alliances within the Caucasus. Vassalize Circassia in the peace treaty and get their money. You need every cent. If the player gets more than Bessarabia and Birlad from Moldavia, then Circassia can not be vassalized due to a potentially powerful coalition. Despite this, a few countries can enter a coalition, but they will most likely not declare war. In most games, Ottomans or Hungary will guarantee Wallachia, and this would help against a coalition, but the entire Moldavia can not be taken in one war, and another war will be needed. It is better not to risk and take only the two provinces in this first war.

After this opening, Wallachia will be a little bit stronger, and will be able to get an alliance with Poland, Bohemia or Hungary, depending on the situation. Wallachia now has access to the Black Sea and can fabricate claims on Crimea and Theodoro, as well as having the possibility to expand into the Caucasus using the claims of vassilized Circassia. One drawback at this moment is that Wallachia can not create claims directly within the Caucasus, and sometimes Circassia will not offer the right claims. Thus, Theodoro should become the player's next target, but the right opportunity has to appear. Lithuania, Crimea, or Great Horde must be kept friendly in order to have military access to the Caucasus. From this moment, the player has to keep open their chances to expand in any direction the possibility appears. Wallachia must be aggressive and grow rapidly. If not, one of its neighbors will see it as easy prey, especially if Wallachia's ally becomes occupied somewhere else.

**Alternative opening moves analyzed:**

\- Imereti has an old ruler without an heir. Royal marriage and get them in PU: Yes, this is true. Imereti very often falls under Georgia PU, but for Wallachia it is hard to get this PU. This strategy works better with Moldavia. Anyway, this is a possibility that shall be considered, beside the Moldavian attack. Only this PU will not give sea access for Wallachia, which means less opportunities for expansion.

\- Make Byzantium a vassal, prevent the Ottomans to take it: Byzantium is usually allied also to Serbia, so this is a hard war for Wallachia. The second problem is that Ottomans will rarely give military access, and even when they do, they tend to attack Byzantium soon after Wallachia attacks them. Then they either siege down Constantinopole before Wallachia can, or Wallachia can not vassalize Byzantium. Constantinople can not be annexed directly, having no sea access.

\- Join the Albanian-Ottoman war, use Skanderbeg to defeat the Ottomans: Albania is almost always guaranteed by Venice, and most likely has another ally. When Ottomans are attacking them, it is a hard war for Ottomans, as numbers are even. Wallachia can also attack Ottomans during this war, and defeat them together with Albania. The problem is that without the Moldavian attack, Wallachia will have to attack alone, and not being an ally with Albania means one cannot not attach their army to Skanderbeg. Also, Albania tends to sign a white piece, if some progress is gained against Ottomans, leaving Wallachia alone in the war. But if the Ottomans attack Albania when Wallachia already has an ally (it shall be Hungary in this case, because only Hungary will go to war without favor, if Wallachia promises land), than Wallachia can win this war, and this helps to handle the Ottomans early. In this case, it will not be possible to keep the Ottomans friendly later, which is a big threat. As an alternative, Wallachia can ally Albania, to be called to war directly, the problem is that in this case Ottomans will delay the attack against Albania, until they will be more powerful. If the war happens, Albania can still end it with white piece, or without giving land to Wallachia. The other alternative is that during the war, Wallachia will rent out his army as condottieri, to Albania. This way Albania can win the war, taking land from the Ottomans, while Wallachia can keep the good relations with Ottomans

\- Expand to Serbia/Bosnia: For this one, military access is needed through Hungary. Serbia and Bosnia are usually allied and can unite their army, granting them a huge advantage. This is a hard war for Wallachia at the beginning, but a good player can win the war and vassalize Bosnia (beware of a coalition). Later, Serbia can be fed to Bosnia. Anyway, I don't recommend this as opening move, because during this war, Moldavia will become a vassal, and Romania will remain landlocked. I recommend this move after the Moldavian attack, once reduced aggressive expansion allows it. Perhaps in a moment when Serbia is fighting a war against Venice. Leave Venice to take some Bosnian land that they want, and vassalize what remains. This way aggressive expansion is lower, and perhaps Serbia can be vassalized and Bosnia directly fed to them. Getting these lands helps to stop the Ottoman advance into Hungary.

**Alliances:**

Wallachia's best ally against Ottomans is Muscovy, but they cannot ally at the beginning. Wallachia has to pick at least Poland, Bohemia, or Hungary as a first ally, but it is best if they can ally two of these countries. Poland sooner or later will rival Muscovy, while Hungary can get permanent claims on Wallachia, and anyway they are an early game war target, so these alliances will not be for long term. The best option is Bohemia. In order to get the alliances, always manually set the target countries to friendly, when possible, and if they rival Ottomans or another enemy of you, don't forget to set Threatened relation status between you and their rival. This increases their willingness to ally you. Also keep an eye on what common land both your ally and you desire, and remove these lands from your wish list if you see that the alliance can potentially break.

**Ideas:**

Defensive first: With this idea, and with Cossacks, Wallachia can have superior morale to Ottomans, and can thus beat them easily in battle. Quantity is not a good choice, as the additional troops and manpower will not help. Ottoman armies will always be numerically superior to the Wallachian military early game.

Trade idea: Having problems with the economy? Then this is a good choice as a second idea. It will start to work at full power the moment Wallachia annexes trade centers like Constantinopole, granting a massive bonus to Wallachia's income. This allows Wallachia to construct a multitude of buildings, nominally Universities and Manufacturies, so as to increase the chance of having the late game institutions spawning within the nation. Alternatively, the Influence idea group can be selected in the case Wallachia comes into controlling multiple vassals, the ideas boosting vassal income, which will help the economy overall. However, this can be dangerous, as no relation slots will remain for the powerful allies that Wallachia needs to hold off its powerful neighbors.

Religious idea helps a lot Wallachia, because most of the land they take are not orthodox, so conversion is necessary. This is better than Humanist, because orthodox provinces will receive boost because of the religion. Deus Vult is also great.

Further Ideas shall be quantity, to increase the nr of the already good soldiers, then Influence for reduced unjustified demands and vassal bonuses and either humanist, to help dealing with rebels, either administrative to help with the core cost reduction.

**Handling your neighbors:**

Ottomans: Here the player has to choose between two strategies. Either attack them early (see Albanian war) and actively seek to stop their expansion (this works only if the player is good at warfare), or keep good relations with them at the beginning. For the latter, it is possible to get also a guarantee from Ottomans. After Ottomans get Albania, Byzantium and Anatolia become strong, and it is better to avoid conflict with them. Sooner or later Wallachia will have to fight war after war with them anyway, and has to be prepared for this with alliances. Always seek to get from them Constantinopole and Edirne, as soon as possible (It also completes a mission to impale the current sultan of the Ottomans who will most likely be Mehmed II with 6/4/6 stats an there is a possibility that you can make the Ottomans have a horrible leader bellow 3 stat in every catagory). Silistria is also important to form Romania, and Vidin can be important if Wallachia desires to be connected to Serbia. An Ottoman alliance with Aq Qoyunlu is very good for Wallachia. Usually this alliance happens and in most of the games AQ is extending with Ottoman support, and actually block the Ottomans in Anatolia for a while. Later Ottomans will break the alliance and attack AQ, presenting an opportunity for Wallachia to attack Ottomans. Wallachia must look to all aspects and possibilities to block Ottoman expansion. Wallachia can also get territories from AQ and QQ through the Caucasus, and can block any nation coming out of or through Persia. Getting land in Suez can block African expansion (see The Kinghts part).

Hungary: They have some mission or event that gives them a permanent CB on Wallachia, so a long-term alliance is not viable. Hungary can prove to be invaluable in the very early game, especially in wars against Ottomans or Serbia/Bosnia. Usually they break the alliance with Wallachia quite early. This is still good as they often end up in big wars against Ottomans or Venice anyway, presenting opportunities for Wallachia to take Transylvanian land (Bohemia or Poland are eager to help).

Crimea: Wallachia should pay special attention to them. They have strong alliances usually with Great Horde and Kazan, but because of this, they will get involved in Muscovy wars, and Muscovy will win. Check for the right moment to attack them (When Kazan and Great Horde are not joining, or when Poland-Lithuanian help is assured). It is a key objective to get their land, before they become an Ottoman vassal. Crimean land is necessary to connect the land in Balkan with the land in Caucasus

Theodoro: They tend to have some serious trade league alliances, but usually they are the only ally of Trebizond. Wallachia can no CB Trebizond to get this province. It is a strategic position. From this province claims can be created in along the Black sea coast line, if Circassia is not creating the ones that are needed to do so. Poland and Lithuania: Poland is one of the best early game allies. At the beginning they have too many relations, and thus will not ally Wallachia, but keep relations high and they will accept an alliance soon. If they get the Lithuanian PU, two allies are gained with one slot. Later, the alliance will have to be sacrificed in favor of a Muscovy alliance. In Commonwealth - Muscovy wars, it is better to be at the side of Muscovy and get Commonwealth land, or even better, trigger a war with them and call in Muscovy on your side. Bohemia is also likely to help in these wars.

Bohemia: A good ally against Poland and Hungary, but they will most likely not join a war against Ottomans. They are too far, and thus have no interest to participate in such a war. They usually have good relations with Ottomans too. Don't allow them too much land/power as they can become Emperor, and if so, can make future incursions into the HRE very difficult.

Muscovy: The most valuable ally against Ottomans, but they are very expansionists. Wallachia can choose to allow them to take the territories to form Russia, and get most of the land they want, keeping good relations with them. They will come with massive armies to fight the Ottomans in Caucasus and Anatolia. Wallachia can also choose to expand north from Caucasus, taking Saratov, Ryaza, Smolensk and other valuable lands, stopping Russia to be formed, but in this way they will probably brake alliance and become enemy, so Wallachia will have to look for other ally against Ottomans (France, if they are doing well)

Mamluks: They are a natural enemy of the Ottomans, and at a certain point, Wallachia will be able to ally them. The alliance can be used to help fight the first few wars against Ottomans. However, Mamluks often make poor alliances with other nations, and if Ottomans are attacking them directly, it will drag Wallachia into wars that may be impossible to win. They must be allied only when they have truce with the Ottomans, and as soon as the truce ends, Wallachia must attack Ottomans with its alliance. Mamluks will join for land, if not, break the alliance, as Ottomans will most likely attack them after the war. Spain (Castile, Aragon): They can provide a navy to fight the Ottomans. An alliance is possible after 1500, but the Spanish states or Spain itself may have too many relations, thus the player should remain vigilant and strike up an alliance as soon as the opportunity arises. If an alliance is achieved, the player must maintain high relations to avoid a break.

Venice: Can be allied only for short time. Venice desires the same provinces as Wallachia. Coupled with the differing government types, maintaining an alliance will prove difficult if one is pursued.

The Knights: As soon as Wallachia has Edirne, claim can be fabricated on Knights. Their navy is not big, Wallachia can outnumber them, and there will be also moments when their alliance is weak. From Knights claim can be fabricated on Cyprus, and Wallachia can attack Mamluks (with help from Spanish/Venice navy) and take land in Egypt, to block Ottomans there. This is why the Knights are important target.

Austria: They would be a better ally then Bohemia, because they would participate in a war against Ottomans, but it is hard for Wallachia to ally them.

**Other advice:**

\- Early game is mandatory to keep at least one friendly western neighbor, preferably Venice, Austria, Bohemia, or have access to Adria, to get institutions. It is hard for Wallachia to get the Colonialism and Printing press without friendly western neighbor

\- Always get money and war rep in peace treaties, and invest this money in buildings, and embracing institutions.
