It is up to us to improve upon the old legacies of trade, commerce and ample coin. The institutions of old were rotten to their core, their merchants pleased with mediocrity and corruption. The time has come for us to wipe the slate clean, undo and burn down the status quo! And from its ashes a new Hansa will be born, evolved but untamed!_

Strategy\[[edit](/index.php?title=Gotland&veaction=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Strategy") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Gotland&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Strategy")\]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![Strategy](/images/thumb/a/a2/Years_of_separatism.png/36px-Years_of_separatism.png "Strategy") _The below is **one of many** player suggested strategies for **Gotland**. Bear in mind, due to the dynamic nature of the game, it may unfold differently for other players._

Starting Position: When you start as Gotland you get an event from start, with a choice: should Gotland be a Monarchy or a Republic? If you pick Republic a new event will fire that makes you choose between Plutocracy republic or a Pirate republic and gives you a unique set of missions. So in total there are three sets of different missions you can decide at the start of the game. Note that you can't undo your pick in this run.

*   **Monarchy Gotland:** Pick this option to get a monarchy government reform and a smaller mission tree that leads you to fight Denmark and become Denmark. There are also events to help you for that. Keep in mind that one event gives you strong support by the emperor of the HRE if you promise to give back the two provinces owned by Holstein at the beginning of the game. If you manage to siege the capital of Denmark you will instantly have the possiblity to end the war in your favor and get a PU over Denmark. With the next missions you can instantly inherit Denmark and become Denmark. You get Denmark's mission tree & events after forming Denmark. After you form Denmark some of the rebellion events regarding the Kalmar union will not fire anymore (for details see mission rewards) and you have an easier run as a Kalmar Union leading Denmark.

*   **Plutocracy Gotland** Pick this option to get a plutocratic goverment reform and a mission tree regarding mainly the Baltic sea trade and competing with the Hansa/Lubeck.

*   **Pirate Gotland!** Pick this option to become a pirate republic and a mission tree regarding raiding and privateering mainly focusing on Europe but also colonizing the Caribbean. Pirate Gotland might be the best pirate nation in EU4 due to the fact that Gotland can be run by pirates from start and that they have a good mission tree with some nice permanent bonuses (other pirate nations might have better starting locations though with less scary neighbours). Later Gotland can form Scandinavia with a larger mission tree.

Monarchy Gotland\[[edit](/index.php?title=Gotland&veaction=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Monarchy Gotland") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Gotland&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Monarchy Gotland")\]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The main goal for Monarchy Gotland is to become Denmark as soon as possible and continue the campaign as Denmark.

When Monarchy Gotland has finnsihed its small mission tree it will become Denmark and recive the following bonuses for the rest of the game:

*   **−25%** Liberty desire in any subjects
*   **+1** Monarch administrative skill
*   −25% Nobles influence

*   The  Nobility estate will no longer raise any rebels when their land gets seized if their loyalty drops below **30**
*   The Swedish nobels will be much more accepting towars Denmarks rule.
*   Sweden and Norway will be historical friends with Denmark AND have -200% liberty desire.

### Conclusion\[[edit](/index.php?title=Gotland&veaction=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Conclusion") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Gotland&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Conclusion")\]

Start as Monarchy Gotland, get support from HRE emperor, win the war against Denmark probobaly within the first ten years, become Denmark and have a much easier ride as the head of Karlmar Union.

Plutocracy Gotland\[[edit](/index.php?title=Gotland&veaction=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Plutocracy Gotland") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Gotland&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Plutocracy Gotland")\]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Plutocray Gotland have a small mission tree that aim to dominate trade in Novgorod, Baltic, Lübeck and English channel and forming the Hanseatic League.

### Bonuses for the rest of the game:\[[edit](/index.php?title=Gotland&veaction=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Bonuses for the rest of the game:") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Gotland&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Bonuses for the rest of the game:")\]

*   From a few different missions: **+25%** Mercantilism in total
*   +**25** trade power in english channel.
*   **+25%** Ship trade power
*   Visby: **+5** Trade value, **−10%** Local development cost
*   Sjælland: **+3** Local trade power, **+3** Hostile fleet attrition, **+2** Possible number of buildings, **−5%** Cost to promote mercantilism

*   **If the  The Aristocrats faction is in power:**
    *   **+5%** Discipline
    *   **+10%** Ship durability
    *   **+10%** The aristocrats influence
*   **If the  The Traders faction is in power:**
    *   **+25%** Global trade power
    *   **+25%** Trade efficiency
    *   **+0.1** Monthly traders influence
*   **If the  The Guilds faction is in power:**
    *   **−15%** Development cost
    *   **+0.5** Yearly republican tradition
    *   **+0.1** Monthly guilds influence

### Gotland forming The Hanseatic League\[[edit](/index.php?title=Gotland&veaction=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Gotland forming The Hanseatic League") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Gotland&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Gotland forming The Hanseatic League")\]

*   Lübeck does not exist
*   Owns core province Hamburg (44)
*   Owns core province Lübeck (45)
*   Owns core province Bremen (1874)
*   Owns less than 25 non-colony provinces
*   Gotland is the strongest trade power in Lübeck trade node

### Conclusion\[[edit](/index.php?title=Gotland&veaction=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Conclusion") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Gotland&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Conclusion")\]

Start as a Plutocracy Gotland, form a trade league, get good relations with the HRE emperor and join the HRE. No-CB war on Novgorod and take Neva and perhaps Novogord early, since Muscovy won't dare to attack a HRE memeber, so you should be safe. Hire two mercenary companies and build 10 light ships, get claims on Denmark and declare war and take Sjælland. Slowly take over more trade provinces around the baltic and Lübeck trade node. Eliminate Lübeck, and take Hamburg and Bremen to dominiate trade in Lübeck. Build a great trade fleet to dominate trade in English channel. When no more Gutnish missions are left to complete form [![Flag of Lübeck](/images/thumb/0/09/L%C3%BCbeck.png/20px-L%C3%BCbeck.png)](https://eu4.paradoxwikis.com/L%C3%BCbeck) [the Hanseatic League](/L%C3%BCbeck "Lübeck") and continue on with those great trade related missions.

Pirate Gotland\[[edit](/index.php?title=Gotland&veaction=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Pirate Gotland") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Gotland&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Pirate Gotland")\]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pirate Gotland can be played in a number of different ways like most nations in EU4. One way is to build up power by colonizing heavily, an other is to stay a small island bound nation and plunder the Europeans a lot, the third is to conquer Scandinavia fast and play just like Sweden/Denmark before forming Scandinavia. Become change religion to Totemism or Protestantism?

### Missions\[[edit](/index.php?title=Gotland&veaction=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Missions") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Gotland&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Missions")\]

The mission tree wants Gotland to take a large number of provinces through permanent claims and/or rewards. These provinces are: Lubeck, Danzig, Riga, London and a few cloth producing provinces in the Netherlands, all of Denmark, every trade province in the Baltic sea trade node and all the German trade provinces in the Lübeck trade node and all islands in the Mediterranean Sea. Gotland also has missions for owning Bermuda, Tortuga and at least four other Caribbean provinces through colonization presumably. Gotland is also rewarded for having a certain privateering percentage in different trade nodes and/or raided their coast. Controlling Roma or Venice during a war will yield great rewards too.

### HQ in Old world or New world?\[[edit](/index.php?title=Gotland&veaction=edit&section=13 "Edit section: HQ in Old world or New world?") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Gotland&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: HQ in Old world or New world?")\]

Pirate Gotland has a choice to make in the beginning of the campaign: where will Gotland's power base be? In the old world (Europe) or in the New world (America)? Gotland starts in the old world, with one province in the Baltic sea trade node, but can get a new start in the new world, in the Caribbean trade node early on. Gotland's missions are tailored for both regions, but time is of the essence! The Caribbean node will close fast once the Iberians get there and the Baltic sea node will close once Poland and [![Flag of Muscovy](/images/thumb/4/41/Muscovy.png/20px-Muscovy.png)](/Muscovy "Muscovy") [Muscovy](/Muscovy "Muscovy") becomes big and scary and grabs the lands of the Teutonic order, [![Flag of Riga](/images/thumb/4/4c/Riga.png/20px-Riga.png)](/Riga "Riga") [Riga](/Riga "Riga"), the [![Flag of Livonian Order](/images/thumb/8/81/Livonian_Order.png/20px-Livonian_Order.png)](/Livonian_Order "Livonian Order") [Livonian Order](/Livonian_Order "Livonian Order") and Novgorod. Once the HQ is chosen Gotland should at least have a presence in the other area (for raiding range and the possibility to privateer) while spreading to adjacent nodes. Pirates generally wants to spread out on the globe, by owning an island here and there close to evert major trade node and rich coastline.

The new world route offers lots of wealthy provinces to colonize if Gotland can get there early. Gotland might hit the gov cap fast when the whole strategy is to colonize everything and take the natives lands by force. Also much of the trade will go to Europe from Caribbean, Chesapeake Bay and gulf on St. Lawrence, even if Gotland owns every province in the node. The old world route offers better raiding since Europe is packed with high dev provinces. The old world route can still colonize, but doing so in the new world, colonial nations will form, which is great if you can't get allies AND the Naval force limit bonus that Private enterprise offers is very nice. But bad to hand over control over the nice monuments located in the new world to colonial nations.

### Religion\[[edit](/index.php?title=Gotland&veaction=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Religion") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Gotland&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Religion")\]

Staying catholic is a good option in the early colonial era for Gotland because of the Treaty of Tordesillas. If Gotland is the first to have five cities in Caribbean, Portugal and Spain will colonize Brazil and Argentina instead. That means the Caribbeans is Gotland's without competition until Anglican England arrives.

A pirate Gotland republic is in a unique position to benefit greatly from Totemism. This because Totemism only exists amoung the natives in North America which is very close to Bermuda that Gotland can get early on. Also, with elections as often as every 3 years Gotland can get many ancestors to choose from in a very short period of time. The downside is the relation penalty with every other christian European nation, relations that is frosty to begin with because ot all the raiding and privateering...

Totemist nations can (at a cost of 400 diplo points each) pick 10 ancestors traits from thier past leaders of the 32 traits that leaders can have. Here are the 16 best traits for a pirate Totemist Gotland, five are super great, the rest can be great too but are more situational.

### Starting suggestions for OWR going Totemist\[[edit](/index.php?title=Gotland&veaction=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Starting suggestions for OWR going Totemist") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Gotland&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Starting suggestions for OWR going Totemist")\]

1.  Send all Light ships to privateer in Novgorod trade node. Send merchant to collect in Novgorod and Krakow. Build 1 light ship and 2 galleys. Destroy the fort in Gotland. Disband 1 cavalry unit. Unpause.
2.  Focus on getting the mission **Gotlander Pirate Fleet** from start (Naval force limit 20, at least 20 ships and at least 6 of those must be light ships), to get claims on Denmark. Dev up Gotland from 10 to 14 (to get Naval force limit to 20) and build ships until 20 (1 lightship and the rest Galleys). Keep building Galleys until at least 15 Galleys.
3.  Declare war on Denmark and during the war sink 20 Danish ships (or make sure they only have max 5 ships left), to get the mission **Sink the Danes.** Important to claim this mission before the peace deal in which Gotland takes Sjælland (for trade power and raiding range), Shetland and Färöarna (for raiding range and colonization range). Before the peace get to admin tech 5 (est time 1466, but at a cost can get earlier), pick exploration ideas and unlock the first three ideas (to get colonization range +50%) or the first two ideas and get a Navigator advisor (to get +20% colonization range), or you can't take the Shetland islands in the peace deal (and lose colonization range to Bermuda). At least 1200 admin and 1200 (or 800+advisor) diplo points are needed, could be done before 1460.
4.  Hire an explorer and find Bermuda as fast as possible to claim the mission **Beyond the Sound Toll** to get a colony in Bermuda started.
5.  Core Sjælland and claim the mission **Kronborg, the Pirate Castle** to make Sjællands monument lever 2.
6.  When Bermuda is a city colonize Borikén first (for the dev 10, monument and trade power) and then Torgua (mission and monument). Then Havana (raiding range to the gulf of Mexico and trade power) and Aruba (colonizing range to Ivory coast and tradepower) and later Cartagena (for the monument). To claim the mission **Pirates of the Caribbean** you need five provinces in the colonial Caribbean, not cities so they could be colonies. So start a fifth colony claim the mission and then abandon colony (so no colonial nation is formed). When you claim the mission, don't move the capital to the Caribbean**.** When Tortuga is a city claim the mission **The Worst Pirate** to get the Tortuga great project to level 2.
7.  In order for Gotland to become totemist: declare a no CB war against a small coastal totemist nation with 3-4 coast allies while colonizing Borikén and Tortuga if you can. Take a province from one native nation fast to start a missionary early. Win the rest of the war as fast as possbile and take 4-5 totemist coast provinces.
8.  Build a fort in 1 totemist province (when it is done mothball it), send a 0% missionary to an other totemist province (to trigger religious totemist rebels) and core the rest.
9.  Aim to have more development in totemist provinces than catholic provinces, or close to it, when the totemist rebels spawn. In Europe (safe from totemist rebels) the nation of Gotland should have around 40 dev (Gotland 14, Sjælland 20, Shetland 3 and Färöarna 3), this means that the totemist developlent must be more than 40 in the new world in order for Gotland to become totemist. The totemist rebels will probaly spawn before the two colonies after Bermuda is done (the rebels count colonies the same as normal provinces so no worries). That means that there are three catholic provinces that needs to be converted by the rebels: Bermuda 3, Tortuga 5 and Borikén 10. But it leaves a need for at least 23 more totemist development to be taken from the natives. The natives provinces are often around 5-7 dev this early, so 4-5 provinces are then needed. Mana can be used to dev up totemist provinces if needed.
10.  The rebels win when they hold more than 50% (around 7-8 provinces is enough to win probably) of the total provinces (around 12-14) in the nation AND one fort. If the totemist dev is greater than the catholic dev when they win, Gotland becomes totemist. When the rebels spawn they will most likely first take controll of the main land provinces and later Bermuda, Tortuga and Borikén. Therefore is it a good idea to have some troops close by to free some totemist provinces from the rebels if the rebels are close to winning but haven't converted enough provinces yet to force a change in national religion.
11.  **Ta-ta! A Swedish Totemist Pirate Gotland republic!** Could be done before 1480.

### Subject nations\[[edit](/index.php?title=Gotland&veaction=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Subject nations") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Gotland&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Subject nations")\]

Colonies: Gotland is in the position to form a few great colonial nations early. Colonial Canada and Colonial Eastern America are the first two that comes to mind if going totemist and already have som provinces in thiese regions it will be easy. Much later colonial Australia could be formed.

Vassals: If the general strategy is to only have easily defended islands, then vassals with _Scutage_ enabled lets vassals stay out of all wars that Gotland is part of AND must pay more to the overlord Gotland.

### Trade company\[[edit](/index.php?title=Gotland&veaction=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Trade company") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Gotland&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Trade company")\]

Trade companies are a great tool for pirate Gotland to earn more money and to stay under the dev cap, but that is for later in the game. A trade company offers less dev cost than a core province but have higher trade power, plus +1 merchant if over 50% in the trade region. The trade company buildings are not that great for Gotland: +5 naval force limit for 1000 ducats seems too much. Early game Gotland will be low on dev and needs every port. So don't start any trade company, core everything instead (and convert religion), unless you can get the +1 mechant.

Every Trade company province gives 0.5 Naval force limit + 10% of dev, trade center, shipyard and everything else. A core gives 0,5 naval force limit if the dev of the province is 5, plus 2 for a shipyard (that you should build everywhere) and +2 for a trade center. So a trade company province provides perhaps 0,6 and a core at least 2,5. With Gotlands bonuses to naval forcelimit the difference will be greater with time. At starts +50% but will early 1500s have +100%, later 1500s around +200%. So mid 1500s 1,2 for evert trade company province but 5 for every core...

### Buildings\[[edit](/index.php?title=Gotland&veaction=edit&section=18 "Edit section: Buildings") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Gotland&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: Buildings")\]

Most buildings have the same importance for Gotland as for other nations, but a few are worth mentioning.

Shipyards should be built in every core province that has a port. The +2 naval force limit for other nations are +3 for Gotland from start and early 1500 it is +4, Mid 1500s it could be +6. Once of the keys to a pirate Gotland is naval force limit.

Courthouse should be build everywhere because pirates get +75% gov cost, but wait for the gov cap to close in first.

Ramparts are a manufactory not seen much. But it is a great building to have in provinces with straits that you are baiting the enemy to siege in order to suround them with ships, send in the army and stackwipe them. Workes well in provinces like Sjælland, Ösel, Rugen and Åland.

Coastal defence(5) or Naval battery (12) are the kryptonite to pirates. It makes that province safe from any coastal raids forever. It also takes more ships to blockade that province during wartime. Naval battery adds +5 attrition for any hostile fleet. Gotland could take the province and then sell the building if needed. It would be bad to suffer +5 attrition in seazones where Gotland will have ships on no end to block of enemy armies to cross a strait.

### Monuments\[[edit](/index.php?title=Gotland&veaction=edit&section=19 "Edit section: Monuments") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Gotland&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: Monuments")\]

There are some great monuments for pirates, especially pagan pirates. The two best monuments for pirates are located in Gotland and Tortuga. Gotland starts with the one in Gotland (duh) and can easily colonize Tortuga. The monuments in the new world will be handed over to the colonial nations if one is created in that region. So make sure to move the capital to the new world or never get more than 4 provinces in the region where the monumet is to keep it for your self. The monument in Ahiarmiut (Canada) can be transported to Gotland (for 1600 ducats) even if it is in a colonial nations possession, do so midgame. Take the province Benin in the Ivory trade node and convert it to totemist to get the bonuses. The monument in Malta is good for a totemist Gotland because almoust all future enemies are of a different religion than totemism.    

### Privateering\[[edit](/index.php?title=Gotland&veaction=edit&section=20 "Edit section: Privateering") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Gotland&action=edit&section=20 "Edit section: Privateering")\]

At start Novogorod is the best trade node to privateer since it is a medium rich trade node but with low domestic tradepower and very few light ships. Later the goal is to park a huge privateer fleet in the Seville trade node and reap atleast 75% of the trade. This is the best place for privateering, since it is a very rich trade node because both portugal and spain are heavily pulling trade there from Ivory coast and the caribbean AND for the rich treachery fleets heading there. Seville also only usually have medium+ trade power with just a few countries having tradeships there and the landbased tradepower is nog huge. By mid 1500s the node could have 50 ducats per month and privateering could yeild 30 ducats per month plus the treachery fleets. One per colonial nation that produce gold. Usually one from Mexico and from from Peru, that can yeild 150+80 ducats for the privateers. When Seville is well covered, start an other privateer fleet in Genua, Malacca or English chanel.

Gotland can get lots of privateer bonuses from ideas, events and missions, try to get most of them early. Remember to also get any +% to ship tradepower too, since that is the base that the privateering bonuses multipies with (Doctrine and monument in Cartagena for instance).

Trigger the event [The Golden Age of Piracy](/Piratical_events#pirates.20 "Piratical events") by having 25% privateer power in the Caribbean trade node. This will get you a +20% privateering bonus.

### Raiding coast\[[edit](/index.php?title=Gotland&veaction=edit&section=21 "Edit section: Raiding coast") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Gotland&action=edit&section=21 "Edit section: Raiding coast")\]

Position small raiding fleets around the world consisting of 4 light ships each (can raid province with dev 40), in caribbean, Northen Europe, Mediteranian, Indian sea, and Chineas sea.

Attack and take the Maldives for great raiding range around india. Coloinze The Andamans (for raiding india and malacca) and Taiwan (for raiding china and Japan), colonize the falklands or South Georgia (for rading argentina). The berber nations in north africa raid the european coast regualry. But if Gotland (or other none berber nation) can take allt the coastal provinces in north africa from Morocco to Egypt then Gotland will have monopoly on raiding the rich mediterranean coastline.

Make sure not to raid any province from a country Gotland want as an ally in the future.

### Ideas\[[edit](/index.php?title=Gotland&veaction=edit&section=22 "Edit section: Ideas") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Gotland&action=edit&section=22 "Edit section: Ideas")\]

There are a lot of different idea groups that are intreresting for Gotland (the rare Maritime and Naval picks are on the table now). Should Gotland pick ideas based on maximizing what they already are good at or try to minimizing what they struggle with?

Exploration is a great first pick to build up force overseas, followed up by Expansion.

Martime offers a lots of bonuses that are vital to Gotland (Privateer efficiency and Naval force limit among others). Also completing Maritime idea group opends two decisions: Confirm Thalassocracy (**+0.25** yearly navy tradition, **−10%** light ship cost, **+1** merchants, **−5%** diplomatic technology cost, for the rest of the game) and Enlist Privateers (**+10%** embargo efficiency, **+25%** privateer efficiency, **−10%** improve relations for the rest of the game). This makes Maritime ideas almoust a must for Gotland.

Offensive is always a great group that adds bonuses for the army, which is well needed for Gotland, it also offers a great +50% privateer policy together with exploration.

Religious ideas could be good for a totemist Gotland that wants to convert every colonized or claimed province. Also if going totemist it will be hard to get a second missionary outside of this idea group.

Naval offers mainly better ship battle capabilities. Galley and heavy ship combat ability, morale, better admirals and so on. The two best bonuses is perhaps +1 yearly navy tradition and free naval barrage cost. Policy with Maritime +50% blockade effiency and +1 blockade impact on siege. Policy with trade: +40% ship trade power (great for privateering) and -10% light ship cost. This group of ideas is not bad for pirates, there are just so many that are so much better. A strategy based around lots of naval battles with a smaller navy or choosing the pirate king gov reform and maximasing admiral pips could be interessting with Naval.

Quality is both great for the army and the navy.

Innovative is as usal great for a nation that starts small and offer many great bonuses and policies.

### Trade\[[edit](/index.php?title=Gotland&veaction=edit&section=23 "Edit section: Trade") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Gotland&action=edit&section=23 "Edit section: Trade")\]

Since Gotland might not have any strong home trade node (50%+ of the trade power) to guide all the trade to it is important to have as many merchants as possible collecting from different trade nodes all over the globe instead. Lubeck, Baltic Sea, Caribbean and Ivory coast are the usual big ones. But Guld of St:Lawrence, Chesapeake bay, Malacca and North sea could yeild some nice ducats too. So how could Gotland get lots merchants?

*   +2 from start,
*   +1 Colonial Canada (10 provinces),
*   +1 Colonial Eastern America (10 provinces),
*   +1 Colonial Australia (10 provinces),
*   +1 West African Charter (>51% trade power),
*   +1 South African Charter (>51% trade power),
*   +1 Confirm Thalassocracy decision (with full Maritime)
*   +1 Gutnish 5th idea
*   +1 Expansion 2nd idea
*   +2 From Trade ideas

### Allies\[[edit](/index.php?title=Gotland&veaction=edit&section=24 "Edit section: Allies") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Gotland&action=edit&section=24 "Edit section: Allies")\]

Every OPM in 1444 wants strong allies to protect them. That is true also for Gotland. But early on Gotland can't get any good allies, only small nations in the HRE or join a trade league with HRE OPMs... Also Gotland should have picked the tier2 gov reform - The Privateer's Way, which limits Gotland to only able to ally other pirate republics (and there are none untill weak OPM Rügen becomes independent). So Gotland will face all enemies alone untill she is big enough that large nations wants her as an ally, then it is time to pick an other tier2 gov reform and ally that vale. Aim for big nations that Gotland can't raid and that have huge armies, France, Austria or Ottomans comes to minde. France is the best of allies, good fleet and a great army close to Gotlands main enemies: England and Spain, that might be thier sworn enemies. Beware if France are going to colonize same regions as Gotland... When Gotland have gotten that large patron to scare of all the bullies, finaly some peace and quiet! Treat the patron with care, answer yes to everything the patron asks, curry favors and use them to improve the trust all the way to 100 as soon as possible. Gotlands two diplomats won't have much else to do, since other relations are not important and no need to forge claims with tier6 - War Against the World Doctrine enabled. Then it is time to go once the offensive and declare war on bigger european nations like Spain, England or Portugal.

### War\[[edit](/index.php?title=Gotland&veaction=edit&section=25 "Edit section: War") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Gotland&action=edit&section=25 "Edit section: War")\]

As an OPM 1444 it is important to gain provinces fast, by war or colonization or get conquered eventually. Gotland has an interesting position though, being an island with almost only large and scary neighbors. If the navy is good then the scary neighbours won't get to Gotland. The two main strategies for conquest is to either take land around the Baltic early and in time replace the Kalmar union as the major force in the north and fight off the polish and russian invaders that WILL come (especially if they get raided all the time), or Gotland could stay as an island based minor nation in northen Europe and build up force and provinces outside of Europe and when strong enogh gobble up scandinavia. The first option is a high risk high reward that don't play to pirate Gotlands streghts (it is more or less the same strategy as Sweden), the other is a safer path that uses Gotlands advantages better but takes longer. The key to the longer path is to grab provinces that are easily defended with a small army - ie all the small islands.

In the baltic sea: Sjælland, Fyn, Lolland, Bornholm, Rügen, Ösel and Åland.

In the north sea: Shetland, Färöarna, Iceland, Orkney, Outer Hebrides, Inner Hebrides and Mann. When strong enough to defend it, take all of Ireland and block it of against England. Later use Ireland as a stepping stone to take the all of Great brittain.

Islands in the mediterranean could be of interest (for raiding range and privateering), but harder for the navy to defend both north and south of europe. In the rest of the world it is the sam basic island based strategy - no army will get to islands without a navy. Also, some remote low dev islands are too much of a hassle for the enemy to even bother to invade. So some safe islands are Greenland, Bermuda, South Georgia, St:Helena or any island in the indian sea will NEVER se any invaders even with all Gutnish ships on the bottom of the ocean.

Both Denmark and Sweden starts with cores on Gotland so they will attack as soon as they can (Sweden will wait for independence). Every coastal nation that have been raided might attack Gotland, like teutonic order, livonian order, Lubeck and other small German states. Later when Gotland have expanded out of the Baltic sea and the smaller nations are gobbled up, Poland, Sweden, Muscowy and England are the main enemies that will declare war on Gotland. In every war the pattern is almost the same: The large enemy nation declares war on this small pirate nation that has a tiny army and no allies (beacuse you ofcourse picked the The Privateer's Way tier2 gov reform) for an island they want for some reason. Gotlands navy sinks the enemy navy one by one and blocks the enemy army from getting to any island, especilly the war target island, and the ticking war score starts to count in Gotlands favour. While you wait for the warscore to maxout on 25, block as many enemy ports you can and collect good plunder from the blockade. War time is usually a better economical climate for Gotland early because of all the fat blockading money pooring in. If the enemy takes the wartarget island when Gotlands navy are sinking ships in other seazones take back the islands with 2k marines, fast in and fast out and block the island again. If a smaller part of the enemy army is waiting to get to an island lift the blockade and let them get there, close the blockade again and then move in with your entire army and stackwipe them since they can't retreat. This will give you some warscore and prestige. When the warscore is good enough (ticking 25 + 10ish from blockades and the occasional battle) peace out for money, war reps and perhaps one more island you want. The downside is that this peace deal is a sheap one, so they will be back for more soon.

There are two ways to loose wars; Gotlands navy is defeated (probobaly beacuse beeing at war with multiple nations with good navies) so every island can be controlled by their army(s) or a large enemy army gets to the wartarget island (when Gotlands navy is not looking) AND won't leave not matter of baiting is being used, so the ticking war score goes in the enemys favor over time.

### Naval force limit\[[edit](/index.php?title=Gotland&veaction=edit&section=26 "Edit section: Naval force limit") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Gotland&action=edit&section=26 "Edit section: Naval force limit")\]

Playing Gotland is all about naval force limit and spreading out to small islands around the globe. With higher naval froce limit comes more income from privateers and blockading during war time, with more islands comes more income from raiding.

How to get higher naval force limit then?

**In the province**

**Naval force limit**

**Comments**

Per development

**+0.1**

nice but a little low

Trade good bonus: [Naval supplies](/Trade_goods "Trade goods")

(only with [Rights of Man](/Rights_of_Man "Rights of Man"))

**+0.5**

Nice bonus to that province

[Shipyard](/Shipyard "Shipyard")

**+2**

A MUST HAVE, build in every core

[Grand Shipyard](/Grand_Shipyard "Grand Shipyard")

**+4**

Good, but at tech 24 it is a little late to matter much

[Important center of trade](/Important_center_of_trade "Important center of trade")

**+2**

Nice bonus to that province

Being in [trade company](/Trade_company "Trade company")

**+0.5**

Thats is why trade companies are not that good for pirates

[Local autonomy](/Local_autonomy "Local autonomy") (per 1%)

**\-1%**\*

A must to keep autonomu low

**In the nation**

**Naval**

**Comments**

Base for every nation

**+12**

Base

Per Admiralty (trade company investment)

**+5**

10000 ducats for +5?? Too expensive

Increase Navies from Private Enterprise Colony

**+5**

Nice bonuse for 100 ducats

Per large Private Enterprise Colony

**+10**

If forming a colonial nation pick this

_Trading in_ bonus: [Naval supplies](/Trade_goods "Trade goods")

**+20%**

Might happen, dont count on it.

Exploration idea 7: Global Empire

**+25%**

Must pick

Maritime-Expansion policy: Naval Infrastructure

**+33%**

Pick if you can

Gutnish idea 6: Gutnish Merchant Navy

**+33%**

Base

Pirate Republic

**+50%**

Base

Maritime idea 4: Grand Navy

**+50%**

Must pick

Naval force limit conclusion: Have shipyards in every core province, don't form more trade companies unless you are at the gov cap or can get that +1 merchant and keep autonomy low. Pick Maritime and Exploration ideas. A shipyard in a dev 3 province with +211% naval force limit gives 7,15 force limit!! So many low dev islands are better than a few high dev islands since one shipyard gives the same naval force limit as 20 dev.

### Factions\[[edit](/index.php?title=Gotland&veaction=edit&section=27 "Edit section: Factions") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Gotland&action=edit&section=27 "Edit section: Factions")\]

Pirate republics have 3 factions that compete for power. The prefered faction in power is usually the Buccaneers for the +1 Yearly Republic traditon, especially if having the Tier3: Frequent Elections enabled. During wars agains big nations, before having a huge navy make sure the the Captains are in power just for the war for the +**10%** morale of navies and **+1** naval leader fire.

### Estates\[[edit](/index.php?title=Gotland&veaction=edit&section=28 "Edit section: Estates") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Gotland&action=edit&section=28 "Edit section: Estates")\]

Pirates don't start with any estates, but can choose to have Clergy estate enabled with the Tier4 gov reform: Establish Religious Institutions and Burghers estate enabled with Tier7: Empower the Quartermasters. Both are the prefered pick. Nobles can't be enabled by pirates.

Enable alla the usuall privileges as normal, but a few extra are worth mentioning:

*   If Gotland is colonizing a lot enable Burgers _Grant New World Charters_ and Clergys _Establish New World Missions_ together with the _Native Trading Policy,_ so no soldiers are needed to guard colonies from natives.
*   Clergys _Enforced Unity of Faith_ and _Religious Culture_ is well needed to help convert provinces if going totemist (and not use religious ideas) and to convert to swedish culture later.
*   Monopoly on _Trade Good,_ pick all you can, pirates don't earn money from producing goods, it is by stealing them :)
*   Burgers _Private Trade Fleets and Burghers in the Admirality are both g_reat since Gotland will rely heavily on its navy, enable both early.

### Advisors\[[edit](/index.php?title=Gotland&veaction=edit&section=29 "Edit section: Advisors") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Gotland&action=edit&section=29 "Edit section: Advisors")\]

Admin advisor: Inquisitor is probobly the best admin advisor if Gotland is going totemist and don't want to pick religious ideas and have just a few trade company provinces. Master of Mint good if Gotland is stealing a lot of gold. A Theologian is always nice to keep unrest low.

Diplo advisor: Navigator is great the first 100 years and later useless. Naval reformer during wars and Trader during peace.

Military advisor: The usuall Army Reformer or Commandant during wars. But Military Engineer could be good if the strategy is baiting the enemy to an islandfort for attrition and later stackwiping.

### Conclusion\[[edit](/index.php?title=Gotland&veaction=edit&section=30 "Edit section: Conclusion") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Gotland&action=edit&section=30 "Edit section: Conclusion")\]

Pirate Gotland is a fun nation to play that needs an unusual strategy to succeed.
