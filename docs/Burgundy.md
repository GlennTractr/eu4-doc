![Shield Burgundy.png](/images/thumb/3/32/Shield_Burgundy.png/130px-Shield_Burgundy.png)

The Bourgogne branch of the Valois dynasty not only rules the duchy of Burgundy, de jure a French possession, but also a significant part of the Low Countries, Vermandois and the county of [![Flag of Nevers](/images/thumb/9/99/Nevers.png/20px-Nevers.png)](/Nevers "Nevers") [Nevers](/Nevers "Nevers"). In short time they have created a realm that straddles some of the richest parts of [![Flag of France](/images/thumb/d/de/France.png/20px-France.png)](/France "France") [France](/France "France") and the [Holy Roman Empire](/Holy_Roman_Empire "Holy Roman Empire"). Taken together the dukes of Burgundy command enormous wealth. These economic resources have been used by Philippe III, the Good, to expand the influence of his family even further, acquiring title after title along the Meuse and Rhine in an attempt to connect his realm.

While France has spent the last century being torn asunder in the on-going feud between [![Flag of England](/images/thumb/2/21/England.png/20px-England.png)](/England "England") [English](/England "England") and French claimants to the French throne, Burgundy has grown to be the cultural and economic center of western Europe. Nowhere are the knightly ideals of the late middle ages as alive as in Burgundy, with great tournaments, grand feasts, and of course the Order of the Golden Fleece itself. A knightly order created by the Duke, aspiring to recreate the knighthood of the Arthurian legends or Greek myths. The Burgundian court also dominates fashion and art, with fortunes being spent on silk, paintings and fantastic illuminated manuscripts.

The Duchy of Burgundy already rivals many kingdoms in influence, income and even military might. By playing off the English and French against each other the Dukes have for a long time been practically independent. De jure however the Dukes remain both subjects to France and to the Holy Roman Empire. With the Hundred Years War nearing, what looks like, its conclusion, the future of the Duchy seems uncertain. If it continues its meteoric rise Burgundy could be the embryo of a new kingdom. A strong state in the middle of Western Europe. But the dukes have also gained many enemies in this short time. Should Philippe and his successors play their cards right there may be a crown in their future, but that requires taking risks that might well cost them everything, potentially reducing their glorious domain to a footnote in the annals of history.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As of 1.35 Burgundy starts out with a powerful unique government reform, "Burgundian State". It grants 2 diplomatic relations and free fort maintenance along the border with rivals. In addition it allows for the faster integration of PUs.

Burgundy also gets access to a second unique and very powerful reform at level six, the "Council of Mechelen". It reduces liberty desire by 10%, grants 150 government capacity and reduces diplomatic annexation costs by 10%, and, most importantly, disables the Dutch Revolts disaster. This makes it possible to keep the capital in Dijon rather than having to move it to the lowlands.

Strategy\[[edit](/index.php?title=Burgundy&veaction=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Strategy") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Burgundy&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Strategy")\]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![Strategy](/images/thumb/a/a2/Years_of_separatism.png/36px-Years_of_separatism.png "Strategy") _The below is **one of many** player suggested strategies for **Burgundy**. Bear in mind, due to the dynamic nature of the game, it may unfold differently for other players._

The strategies outlined below are heavily reliant on owning the Emperor DLC, due to Burgundy's unique missions they gain from it and the Domination DLC due to changes to the liberty desire of French Vassals. Note that the guide for 1.35 assumes that you own all DLCs.

### 1.35 Strategy\[[edit](/index.php?title=Burgundy&veaction=edit&section=6 "Edit section: 1.35 Strategy") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Burgundy&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: 1.35 Strategy")\]

#### Situation at start\[[edit](/index.php?title=Burgundy&veaction=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Situation at start") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Burgundy&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Situation at start")\]

As Burgundy starts out with its new government reforms and PUs count towards the "Strong Duchies" nobility privilege. This should be granted at the start of the game. Including the diplomatic relation given through Burgundian Ideas Burgundy has now 9 diplomatic relation slots at game start. Three are taken by the lowland PUs and one by Nevers, leaving five open.

In addition, if France is chosen as a rival, the forts in Auxerrois and Picardie become free to maintain - it is not necessary to delete them at the start of the game to preserve money. It also allows Burgundy to finish it's first mission - "Placate Subjects".

Finally, France's vassals are now called "Appange(s)" and have much higher liberty desire making it possible to use the "League of the Public Weal" mission effectively. You need to take eight additional provinces in France and that means high aggressive expansion (AE). Minimizing AE while completing the missions that grant you all French vassals has to be your priority in the early game.

#### Strategy for the first ten years\[[edit](/index.php?title=Burgundy&veaction=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Strategy for the first ten years") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Burgundy&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Strategy for the first ten years")\]

 [![Flag of France](/images/thumb/d/de/France.png/20px-France.png)](/France "France") [France](/France "France") is an existential threat for Burgundy and should be eliminated as soon as possible. At game start [![Flag of France](/images/thumb/d/de/France.png/20px-France.png)](/France "France") [France](/France "France") is considerably stronger, making it imperative to engage in clever diplomacy and understanding the mission tree to turn the situation on its head.

Ideally Burgundy will use it's enormous diplomatic capacity to find strong allies that protect it from France and allow it to turn the French vassals against France.

The first necessary step is to ally [![Flag of Austria](/images/thumb/7/7f/Austria.png/20px-Austria.png)](/Austria "Austria") [Austria](/Austria "Austria") on day one. Next sell your heavies (Your PU Holland is willing to take one giving you 50 ducets). Sell the other one to Scotland. Mothballing forts is not longer necessary though you might want to delete the one in Namur.

Choose your other allies carefully. If you manage to break France you will get up to six additional vassals so you will still lack diplomatic slots ten years into the game. Aragon, if possible, is a good choice as you will lose them to Castile soon if they rival France: get them in by promising land. Allying Castile, again if possible, is also recommended. Bohemia is a also a good choice. Keep at least one slot open in order to release Champagne.

Other steps can include hiring a military advisor in order to reach mil tech four before France and a focus on mil points, although waiting with your focus and setting it to diplo can help if you succeed with the "King of the Franks" mission.

Then and only then choose your rivals. To complete the mission "English Alliance" rival [![Flag of England](/images/thumb/2/21/England.png/20px-England.png)](/England "England") [England](/England "England") (a misnomer, alas, as England never seems to start off friendly), [![Flag of France](/images/thumb/d/de/France.png/20px-France.png)](/France "France") [France](/France "France") (and insult both) and one random nation. If England turns out friendly by and chance do not ally them before the "Surrender of Maine" event has fired.

Focus on improving your relations with the French vassals in order to trigger the mission "League of the Public Weal". Before you trigger trigger the mission, seize Rethel from [![Flag of Nevers](/images/thumb/9/99/Nevers.png/20px-Nevers.png)](/Nevers "Nevers") [Nevers](/Nevers "Nevers") and release [![Flag of Champagne](/images/thumb/0/05/Champagne.png/20px-Champagne.png)](/Champagne "Champagne") [Champagne](/Champagne "Champagne") as a vassal. This will grant you access to the reconquest CB. [![Flag of Champagne](/images/thumb/0/05/Champagne.png/20px-Champagne.png)](/Champagne "Champagne") [Champagne](/Champagne "Champagne") has cores on Nemours, Troyes, Valois and Reims. By using Champagne's reconquest CB, you only take 25% AE for taking Champagne's cores back. Ideally you have reached level 4 mil tech at the same time. Your goal has to be to take ALL of the cores of [![Flag of Champagne](/images/thumb/0/05/Champagne.png/20px-Champagne.png)](/Champagne "Champagne") [Champagne](/Champagne "Champagne") and Paris (for yourself) in this war, adding five out of eight provinces in France. Note that you should focus only on the French army in this war - try not attack any of France's vassals. It also helps to hire a Mercenary company with a skilled siege general.

To finish the mission of King of the French you need eight additional provinces or three after you have taken all the cores of [![Flag of Champagne](/images/thumb/0/05/Champagne.png/20px-Champagne.png)](/Champagne "Champagne") [Champagne](/Champagne "Champagne") and Paris. Both Savoy and Provence have rulers that get excommunicated - be opportunistic. If you are lucky you can also snatch Calais from England or even parts of Normandy.

Once you can trigger the mission you have reached your first goal - you neutralized France. Try to annex Champagne and Nevers asap in order to keep your diplomatic relations manageable.

#### Navigating the Inheritance\[[edit](/index.php?title=Burgundy&veaction=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Navigating the Inheritance") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Burgundy&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Navigating the Inheritance")\]

Your starting ruler, Philippe the Good, is a 48 year old 5/5/5. In real life Philippe died in 1467, but as he is a starting general in the game he tends to die very early on. Keeping him alive is annoying and might be considered too cheesy by many players. Charles is already your heir apparent, but he is a 2/0/4. He has Marie as his scripted heir, she is a 4/5/3. Once you have Charles as your heir you can get an event to make Marie your heiress. Make so if you can. Even if you do not have her as an heiress it is still possible to get her once Charles dies if he has no heir or an heir whose claim is not strong.

When Charles dies, Marie will take charge. Initially, you will then be presented 4 options: Stay independent, integrate into [![Flag of France](/images/thumb/d/de/France.png/20px-France.png)](/France "France") [France](/France "France"), integrate into the Holy Roman Empire, or integrate into a strong royal marriage partner.

The strategy of vassalizing France from 1.30 does not work in 1.31 or later patches unless you cheese things and are able to vassalize France after the inheritance event has begun. You can chose to fall under a PU with the Emperor, France (if they exist and are independent), your strongest ally, or you can choose to stay independent otherwise. At this point, if you don't go for the France PU, if you're at peace with [![Flag of France](/images/thumb/d/de/France.png/20px-France.png)](/France "France") [France](/France "France"), they will most likely declare a reunification war. This will call in your allies in, so this should be extremely easy.

In the case of independence, the Emperor will almost always demand the Lowlands at this stage. When this happens, take the Great Privilege choice. This will inherit ALL of your PU subjects (in the lowlands), allowing you to upgrade to Kingdom rank and state some extremely wealthy land. Congratulations, you are the strongest nation in Western Europe. Consider moving your capital to the lowlands, Bruges is often a good choice. It means you'll avoid the Dutch Revolts disaster later on. It's usually also much easier to defend than Dijon. Alternatively the new government reform "Council of Mechelen" allows you to keep your capital in Dijon. In this case you should move your trade capital to the lowlands so that you can dominate the English Channel trade.

If you chose to fall under a PU, you will inherit all your vassals and PUs in France, the lowlands and the HRE. Note that if you have PU'ed Castile or Milan for example, your new overlord will get these PUs. Falling under a PU with an independent France has become very risky as of 1.31, as you are blocked from declaring a war for independence until the Imperial Incident is over. This incident allows the Emperor to demand the lowlands and it is very RNG driven. Many video guides propose this strategy as it is quite dramatic but you might end up with losing half of your country. If you are lucky Marie dies in between and you automatically declare an independence war but it is also very RNG dependent. You can of course try to save-scum but this is not a recommended strategy for casual players. If you fell under a PU with France one way out of this is to declare a standard (no CB) war against one's overlord. It breaks the event chain though and entry into the HRE seems to be blocked.

If you choose Austria as your PU partner you can somewhat influence the outcome by a) having weakened France and b) having below 50% liberty desire (LD). Then Austria will choose to keep the PU with Burgundy. You will still be forced into a war for independence when Marie dies but at least your country will not be gutted. In case your LD is too high simply delete troops until it is low enough.

Now for the second part of the event chain. If you stayed independent, you can ask the Emperor to join the HRE or stay outside. There is no optimal choice here - entry causes you to stay at Duchy level and causes major issues with government capacity. Staying outside blocks expansion into the lowlands, in particular if there is a strong emperor like [![Flag of Austria](/images/thumb/7/7f/Austria.png/20px-Austria.png)](/Austria "Austria") [Austria](/Austria "Austria"). Probably the best outcome is to ask for entry and be denied. That rarely happens if you are allied to the emperor. If you manage to get rejected you get PU CBs on all electors that are not Bishoprics and subjugation CBs on those. Using the PU CB's can almost guarantee you the emperorship. Note that if you enter the HRE you will lose your Kingdom rank and the government capacity that comes along with it, unless you are the Emperor. Hopefully you have seized enough land from your estates to grant the privileges that give government capacity boots.

  

### 1.34 or before.\[[edit](/index.php?title=Burgundy&veaction=edit&section=10 "Edit section: 1.34 or before.") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Burgundy&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: 1.34 or before.")\]

At game start try to ally [![Flag of Austria](/images/thumb/7/7f/Austria.png/20px-Austria.png)](/Austria "Austria") [Austria](/Austria "Austria") and [![Flag of Castile](/images/thumb/e/ee/Castile.png/20px-Castile.png)](/Castile "Castile") [Castile](/Castile "Castile"). This should almost always be possible. To complete the mission English Alliance rival [![Flag of England](/images/thumb/2/21/England.png/20px-England.png)](/England "England") [England](/England "England"), [![Flag of France](/images/thumb/d/de/France.png/20px-France.png)](/France "France") [France](/France "France") (and insult both) and one random nation. You can sell your two heavies for 40 ducets each to Irish minors (sometimes Holland as well) for some early cash. You should probably also mothball two forts to conserve cash.

If you own the Art of War DLC, you can press for your subject's CBs. Complete the mission Placate Subjects by Supporting Loyalists in your PU subjects, take the mission and revoke Support Loyalists. Then you can seize Rethel from [![Flag of Nevers](/images/thumb/9/99/Nevers.png/20px-Nevers.png)](/Nevers "Nevers") [Nevers](/Nevers "Nevers") and release [![Flag of Champagne](/images/thumb/0/05/Champagne.png/20px-Champagne.png)](/Champagne "Champagne") [Champagne](/Champagne "Champagne") as a vassal. This will grant you access to the reconquest CB. [![Flag of Champagne](/images/thumb/0/05/Champagne.png/20px-Champagne.png)](/Champagne "Champagne") [Champagne](/Champagne "Champagne") has cores on Nemours, Troyes, Valois and Reims. By using Champagne's reconquest CB, you only take 25% AE for taking Champagne's cores back. Use the Strong Duchies privilege to reduce Nevers' liberty desire (LD) as it grants you -10% LD and two extra relations slots. If LD is still too high, develop Nevers to reduce LD below 50%.

It's also helpful to own Res Publica or Common Sense. You will be able to set a national focus, and it is HIGHLY recommended you set it to military. All advisors hired should be level 1 to conserve cash and generate some extra Monarch Points in each category. Try to get an improve relations advisor to stack with the English Alliance buffs as well as a morale of armies/discipline advisor. Otherwise, your advisors aren't significant. Your starting ruler is a 48 year old 5/5/5 with the Well Advised trait (traits require Rights of Man), and since you can stack advisor cost reductions with estate privileges, starting advisors can be 45% cheaper if you take the estate privilege to lower their costs. In real life Philipp died in 1467, but as he is a general in the game he tends to die very early on. Keeping him alive is annoying and might be considered too cheesy by many players.

Now that you are done with these steps, it should be early December 1444. In 1.31 and later patches Savoy is often excommunicated at game start. If they rival Austria, which also often happens, you can take two border provinces without much much aggressive expansion (AE) and you do not have to fight the Emperor. Before the war starts, slacken recruitment standards twice to get full manpower. Afterwards, consider hiring a Merc company with a 2 pip (or better) siege general, it will be important later on as you need to win a lot of siege races. It will also help you conserve manpower. Do not overly worry about loans, the money and war reparations you get from your neighbours will be more than enough to finance your wars.

Wait until you have reached mil-tech 4 while currying favours with [![Flag of Austria](/images/thumb/7/7f/Austria.png/20px-Austria.png)](/Austria "Austria") [Austria](/Austria "Austria") (assuming you own the Leviathan DLC). You'll reach both around 1449. Once you have mil-tech 4 and enough favours to call in [![Flag of Austria](/images/thumb/7/7f/Austria.png/20px-Austria.png)](/Austria "Austria") [Austria](/Austria "Austria"), declare on [![Flag of France](/images/thumb/d/de/France.png/20px-France.png)](/France "France") [France](/France "France") with Champagne's reconquest CB. The war should be easy as you can often stack wipe the French Armies (though 1.33 makes this harder). If you are very good you can try to solo France, though that is a risky adventure. Your focus should be on stack-wiping as many French troops as possible. You might have to hire additional mercenary companies during the war as your regiments recover soldiers too slowly. Be aware that until you take Verdun or Chartres you cannot reach the other part of your country as those two forts block your way. By calling in an ally, France will usually concentrate on your ally, giving you crucial time to siege down Verdun and getting Provence out of the war. You can take Paris and all cores of Champagne (four in total) for about 50 AE (and 94 war score). Paris is very expensive in terms of war score because of its two monuments since 1.31, but you need to take it in this war as you need it cored in order to trigger the King of France mission later on. You can also consider taking Bordeaux (but not Labourd) in order to release Gascony.

If you managed to take Bresse from Savoy you are now two provinces short of triggering the King of France mission (though you first need to finish the League of Public Weal mission.) Trigger the League mission once France has almost integrated one of their vassals and hope that the vassals do not declare a war of independence. Then it is time for one more war, either taking two provinces from England, or ideally from Provence. If you are lucky Provence gets excommunicated too and you can take all four provinces in the Lorraine area. If not two are enough but the ones from Lorraine are more important than the ones Provence owns directly. In case France gets called into this war focus on killing French troops and keep the troops of her vassals alive. It might be better not to separate peace France as the French vassals cannot declare a war of independence as long as France is in the war. Alternatively, wait until you have enough war score to peace out France for money and Provence the day after for land. Once you own the provinces pause the game and consider if you want to trigger the King of the France mission.

Note that you will end up with up to six French vassals. You can probably handle 3-4 but probably not six, so consider releasing some of the vassals in the peace deal. If you plan on releasing Gascony and Toulouse later on, Armagnac and Foix are less useful and can be conquered for little AE afterwards. Also, you should try to annex Champagne and Nevers asap, hopefully you'll manage to integrate at least one before you trigger the King of the Franks mission. Otherwise you will be severely over your relations limit, in particular if Charles is already your ruler. Make him a general since he is a 2/0/4. The hard part is over. If you get the event to make Marie your heir, do so. She is a 4/5/3.

When your ruler dies, Marie will take charge. Initially, you will then be presented 4 options: Stay independent, integrate into [![Flag of France](/images/thumb/d/de/France.png/20px-France.png)](/France "France") [France](/France "France"), integrate into the Holy Roman Empire, or integrate into a strong royal marriage partner.

The strategy of vassalizing France from 1.30 does not work in 1.31 or later patches. You can chose to fall under a PU with the Emperor, France (if they exist and are independent), your strongest ally, or you can choose to stay independent otherwise. At this point, if you don't go for the France PU, if you're at peace with [![Flag of France](/images/thumb/d/de/France.png/20px-France.png)](/France "France") [France](/France "France"), they will declare a reunification war. This will call [![Flag of Castile](/images/thumb/e/ee/Castile.png/20px-Castile.png)](/Castile "Castile") [Castile](/Castile "Castile") and [![Flag of Austria](/images/thumb/7/7f/Austria.png/20px-Austria.png)](/Austria "Austria") [Austria](/Austria "Austria") in, so this will be extremely easy.

In the case of independence, the Emperor will almost always demand the Lowlands at this stage. When this happens, take the Great Privilege choice. This will inherit ALL of your PU subjects (in the lowlands), allowing you to upgrade to Kingdom rank and state some extremely wealthy land. Congratulations, you are the strongest nation in Western Europe. Consider moving your capital to the lowlands, Bruges is often a good choice. It means you'll avoid the Dutch Revolts disaster later on. It's usually also much easier to defend than Dijon.

If you chose to fall under a PU, you will inherit all your vassals and PUs in France, the lowlands and the HRE. Note that if you have PU'ed Castile or Milan for example, your new overlord will get these PUs. Falling under a PU has become very risky as of 1.31, as you are blocked from declaring a war for independence until the Imperial Incident is over. This incident allows the Emperor to demand the lowlands and it is very RNG driven. You might end up with losing half of your country. If you are lucky Marie dies in between and you automatically declare an independence war but it is also very RNG dependent. You can of course try to save-scum but this is not a recommended strategy for casual players. One way out of this is to declare a standard war against one's overlord. This is presumably an oversight and will be soon patched out.

Now for the second part of the event chain. If you stayed independent, you can ask the Emperor to join the HRE or stay outside. There is no optimal choice here. Probably the best outcome is to ask for entry and be denied. That rarely happens if you are allied to the emperor. If you manage to get rejected you get PU CBs on all electors that are not Bishoprics and subjugation CBs on those. Using the PU CB's can almost guarantee you the emperorship. Note that if you enter the HRE you will lose your Kingdom rank and the government capacity that comes along with it, unless you are the Emperor. Hopefully you have seized enough land from your estates to grant the privileges that give government capacity boots. This will mean the Emperor will no longer be able to interfere with your expansion, however.

If you want to continue expand in France take provinces that have Gascon and Toulousian cores and repeat the strategy you used with Champagne to take over most of France. You could also expand into Italy when it leaves the HRE, which has some incredibly rich lands. However, it is very easy to run into a powerful coalition there since a lot of provinces are high development.

During the midgame, you should be an extremely powerful nation who is Emperor of the HRE or a lone Kingdom pressing its claims. You can either choose to become Protestant or stay Catholic, but try to stay away from the Reformed religion as it is notably less powerful than Protestantism's customisable Church Aspects and it can only become the Emperor's Religion if Religious Peace is signed or a Protestant Emperor abdicates in favour of the Reformed religion via The Reformers Protest. Your strategy is dependent on which religion you pick. If you chose Catholicism, it would be best to integrate into the HRE and vie for Emperorship when Marie's heir takes charge, and start rooting heresy out. Try to keep any and all newly appearing heretic religions away from the electors, because if an elector becomes Reformed, Protestant or Anglican, the League Wars will start up and you will have no way to avoid it. If you successfully prevented the League Wars from firing, the Imperial Diet will proclaim Catholicism the official HRE religion as if the Catholic League won the war. This will allow you to enforce religion on any heretical prince (if any exist), and continue centralisation of the HRE.

However, Protestantism is a different story. You will incur extra AE because you will be taking Catholic lands as a Protestant nation, and converting will trigger the Dutch Revolt disaster. This is extremely easy to avoid by moving your capital into the Lowlands for a short period of time, converting your provinces and moving back to the old Burgundian capital of Dijon, or you could choose to set up a new court in the old French city of Paris, move somewhere with high development or even stay in the lowlands. You can alternatively ride out the disaster and spend some diplo points to culture convert 4 provinces to Burgundian culture. When possible, try to use the Reconquest CB as that will allow you to take more lands for much less AE, and try to force-vassalise a nation that has a lot of cores or release one that has many cores. If your endgoal is be to become Emperor of the HRE, you will want to influence the League Wars to your outcome, which should be a victorious Evangelical Union. If it goes awry, you can always choose the Peace of Westphalia which sets Religious Peace. [![Flag of Switzerland](/images/thumb/0/01/Switzerland.png/20px-Switzerland.png)](/Switzerland "Switzerland") [Switzerland](/Switzerland "Switzerland") may choose to leave the Empire, but you can either leave them out of it or declare to bring them back into the imperial fold. As always, you should try going for the provinces needed to form [![Flag of Lotharingia](/images/thumb/3/38/Lotharingia.png/20px-Lotharingia.png)](/Lotharingia "Lotharingia") [Lotharingia](/Lotharingia "Lotharingia"), taking as many provinces as possible without incurring the wrath of a coalition.

You can choose any idea groups you want, although if you want to go for colonialism you should no-cb an Irish OPM like [![Flag of Munster](/images/thumb/e/e5/Munster.png/20px-Munster.png)](/Munster "Munster") [Munster](/Munster "Munster") and take it for yourself as a forward colonisation base. If you did that you should take [Exploration ideas](/Exploration_ideas "Exploration ideas") and [Expansion ideas](/Expansion_ideas "Expansion ideas") first, followed by a military idea or [Religious ideas](/Religious_ideas "Religious ideas"). Your fourth idea can then be whatever you want, although if going for a colonial Holy Roman Empire of Lotharingia run you should take [Exploration ideas](/Exploration_ideas "Exploration ideas"), [Expansion ideas](/Expansion_ideas "Expansion ideas"), a military idea/[Religious ideas](/Religious_ideas "Religious ideas"), [Religious ideas](/Religious_ideas "Religious ideas")/a military idea, [Diplomatic ideas](/Diplomatic_ideas "Diplomatic ideas"). The other three idea groups are up to you, although if going for a pure HRE run you should take [Diplomatic ideas](/Diplomatic_ideas "Diplomatic ideas"), [Religious ideas](/Religious_ideas "Religious ideas") and then a Military idea. [![Flag of Burgundy](/images/thumb/b/b0/Burgundy.png/20px-Burgundy.png)](/Burgundy "Burgundy") Burgundy has several good choices for ideas, and since they will be able to control the wealthy lowlands provinces [Economic ideas](/Economic_ideas "Economic ideas") is a good pick. [Influence ideas](/Influence_ideas "Influence ideas") makes another good pick since it decreases subject LD if you forced a union/vassalage on a nation and reducing costs of unjustified demands is generally good for a vassal swarm. [Espionage ideas](/Espionage_ideas "Espionage ideas") are only good purely for the reduced AE, but the ideas are completely up to the player as [![Flag of Burgundy](/images/thumb/b/b0/Burgundy.png/20px-Burgundy.png)](/Burgundy "Burgundy") Burgundy is good for a range of ideas and playstyles.

  

### Ideas\[[edit](/index.php?title=Burgundy&veaction=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Ideas") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Burgundy&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Ideas")\]

Note: These comments are valid for 1.34 and below but not for 1.35

Burgundy's idea is more focused on economy and mercenary while having good diplomacy, so a small Burgundy could do many style as you want.

*   [Economic ideas](/Economic_ideas "Economic ideas") is a powerful idea group allowing the player to build a strong economy just to be prosperous .
*   [Influence ideas](/Influence_ideas "Influence ideas") allows you a vassal swarm as well as getting faster inheritance from your PU subjects.
*   [Diplomatic ideas](/Diplomatic_ideas "Diplomatic ideas") helps you to control HRE electors and thus expand eastern without the need of colonization.
*   [Innovative ideas](/Innovative_ideas "Innovative ideas") may be desired for a further mercenary cost reduction and cheaper technology.
*   [Exploration ideas](/Exploration_ideas "Exploration ideas") is usually tough for Burgundy because of survival and mediocre location. However, after Annexing France, their economy should be great to hold colonies.
*   [Expansion ideas](/Expansion_ideas "Expansion ideas") with exploration ideas, Burgundy has the best trade node, money from the new world should overcome the cost of colonization.
*   [Administrative ideas](/Administrative_ideas "Administrative ideas") would be a very good choice for its mercenary benefits. If the player is very aggressive, the core-creation cost reduction will also be beneficial.
*   [Quantity ideas](/Quantity_ideas "Quantity ideas") a small Burgundy could do huge army with many forts, essential to defend big nations and expand rapidly.
