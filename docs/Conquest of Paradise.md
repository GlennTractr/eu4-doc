The **Conquest of Paradise** expansion was announced on 2013-11-04[\[1\]](#cite_note-1) and released on 2014-01-14 together with [Patch 1.4](/Patch_1.4 "Patch 1.4"). The expansion focuses on [colonization](/Colonization "Colonization") mechanics, a revamping of the [New World](/New_World "New World"), with a particular focus on making states in North America more interesting and an optional new world randomizer.

[](/File:EU4RandomNewWorld.png "Enlarge")

Randomized map exploration (as of the 1.14 RNW rework).

*   A generator for a [Random New World](/Random_New_World "Random New World"). The generator is limited to pre-colonial starts and isn't compatible with CK2 converted games.
*   An expansive addition of new mechanics for tribal nations in North America including [migration](/Migration "Migration"), [buildings](/Native_council#Native_buildings "Native council"), [native ideas](/Native_ideas "Native ideas"), [reforming the government](/Native_council#Reforming_the_government "Native council"), a new mechanic for [casus belli](/Native_council#Casus_belli "Native council") and [federations](/Federations "Federations").
*   Ability to play as one's Colonial nation

Free features\[[edit](/index.php?title=Conquest_of_Paradise&veaction=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Free features") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Conquest_of_Paradise&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Free features")\]

_Main article: [Patch 1.4](/Patch_1.4 "Patch 1.4")_  

The expansion coincided with a supporting, free patch for the base game, that includes:

*   A new form of formable nations called [colonial nations](/Colonial_nation "Colonial nation"). Colonial nations form when a nation controls 5 cored overseas provinces in the same [colonial region](/Colonial_nation#List_of_colonial_regions "Colonial nation"). They are a subject under the nation forming it, but don't use a diplomatic relation slot. The overlord gets trade power and [tariffs](/Colonial_nation#Tariffs "Colonial nation") from them while they have to be aware of the colonial nation's [liberty desire](/Colonial_nation#Liberty_Desire "Colonial nation") that can cause the colony to declare a war of independence if it increases to above 50%. Colonial nations are playable and have a separate idea group. They use their own, republican form of government; originally they would have governors appointed by the overlord instead of elections (the choice possibly affecting liberty desire), but as of patch 1.8 they are autonomous.
*   [Protectorates](/Subject_nations#Protectorate "Subject nations") are introduced as a subject nation of technological inferiority that cannot be vassalized, but don't take up a diplomacy slot and provide trade power in return for cheaper technology and the ability to call the overlord into defensive wars. They were removed again in patch 1.20.
*   [Climate](/Army#Attrition_modifiers "Army") now starts to play its part in unit attrition.
*   A new interface has been added, where you can view all your current subjects, and view their benefits to your nation.
*   Attrition from being on a boat is added. It is 1% of the total army size and isn't modified.
*   More playable nations in [North America](/New_World#natives "New World") and [Sub-Saharan Africa](/Sub-Saharan_Africa "Sub-Saharan Africa").
*   Added new [events and decisions](/Patch_1.4#Events_.26_Decisions "Patch 1.4").
*   Added new national ideas in North America.
*   Another new feature is the ability to support independence of a vassal, protectorate or colonial nation.

And a plethora of other additions to the game.

Major DLC changes\[[edit](/index.php?title=Conquest_of_Paradise&veaction=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Major DLC changes") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Conquest_of_Paradise&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Major DLC changes")\]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   The "random new world" feature received a major rework in [patch 1.14](/Patch_1.14 "Patch 1.14"). Generation of RNW changed from random provinces to semi-random tile based system to allow for a more detailed RNW.
