**After Action Reports** (**AARs**) are threads posted to the EU4 forums or a personal web site or blog written by players about their ongoing games. They can be written from the game player's personal point of view, or can be written from a fictitious narrative perspective, like a serialized novel. Some writers also blend the two elements, going from a metagame discussion to a fictitious narrative set in their game's alternate history world.

*   **Player Point of View**: "I had a rough time as Austria this last session. It started when Ulm, that darned [OPM](/OPM "OPM"), suddenly brought in half the [HRE](/HRE "HRE") against me when I declared war on it. In all my playthroughs, this was the first time I ever was faced with such a nasty coalition. Before I knew it, not only was I facing the coalition, but the [Ottoman Empire](/Ottoman_Empire "Ottoman Empire") decided to make a [DOW](/DOW "DOW") on me while I was in the thick of it!"

*   **Fictitious Narrative**: "The Emperor sniffed offendedly at the ambassador of Ulm, who stood resolutely defiant regardless of the withering glance directed at him, 'What do you mean that the Archbishop refuses to accede to my demands? You realize that I shall have to invoke my powers to have him removed as an Elector!' Yet the ambassador shocked the court with his retort, 'If that is the sort of tyranny Your Imperial Majesty wishes to promulgate upon his vassals, then perhaps it is time for another Prince to rule in his stead!' He further shocked the court with this revelation, 'Know this: that Bohemia stands with us. As does Saxony, and Bavaria, and Brandenburg and more! If you dare so much as move against our borders, the entire continent shall rise against you!' And yet, it was too late. For the regiments had already crossed the Ulm frontier. War, a great war indeed, was now inevitable."

Players can include screen shots from their games, maps, period art, and other elements to add depth to their reports.
