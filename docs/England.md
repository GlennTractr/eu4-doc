Ever since 1337 the conflict over who is the rightful King of [![Flag of France](/images/thumb/d/de/France.png/20px-France.png)](/France "France") [France](/France "France") has been ravaging both France and England for over a hundred years. The English retain control over [![Flag of Normandy](/images/thumb/3/37/Normandy.png/20px-Normandy.png)](/Normandy "Normandy") [Normandy](/Normandy "Normandy") and Guyenne while Charles VII in Paris has the support of most of the regional nobles of France.

With the treaty of Tours in May, the English Lancasters and French Valois families have seemingly traded territory for peace. Among its stipulation are the handover of the county of Maine, a point that was never cleared with the English Parliament, and which is likely to anger noble and commoner alike on the far side of the channel. The fear of public backlash has so far lead to this handover being stalled for months, with the word of the English negotiators increasingly being questioned in the French court.

England is itself in a precarious situation. A king since he was nine months old, Henry VI has now grown up to assume the crown and actual rule of the kingdom. Even as an adult however Henry seems unwilling to rule, some would say he is even worryingly detached from reality. Intriguing nobles of the realm have instead come to dominate Henry's regime, assuming power and positioning themselves for a future succession. Such feuds might well cripple the internal stability of the Kingdom, especially if hostilities in France commence again.

With the English busy with continental and internal affairs the dominion over Ireland has shrunken to a thin strip along the sea known as 'The Pale', with Gaelic lords as well as Hiberno-Normans acting entirely independent of the English Crown. There are few if any English troops on the island anymore much to the enjoyment of the Irish. Should matters in London and Paris finally settle however, the Irish lords are likely to be made a much higher priority.

_Trade has long been a foundation of English national policy. By extending our influence across borders and controlling its political development domestically, we have managed to become one of the foremost European powers.

Strategy\[[edit](/index.php?title=England&veaction=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Strategy") | [edit source](/index.php?title=England&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Strategy")\]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![Strategy](/images/thumb/a/a2/Years_of_separatism.png/36px-Years_of_separatism.png "Strategy") _The below is **one of many** player suggested strategies for **England**. Bear in mind, due to the dynamic nature of the game, it may unfold differently for other players._

England is a large country in a relatively unique position geographically, mechanically and economically as sea tiles separate the [British Isles](/British_Isles "British Isles") from continental Europe and it controls a significant portion of the English Channel end [trade node](/Trade_node "Trade node").

Defensively, the sea tiles separating the [British Isles](/British_Isles "British Isles") require an invader to utilize transports and associated escorts to launch any successful invasion. Few nations early in the game are able to support the combined army and naval costs required to successfully invade the British Isles and defend from opportunistic continental neighbors. Offensively, the sea tiles reduce the [aggressive expansion](/Relations "Relations") experienced by continental Europe during the consolidation of the British Isles under English rule. Economically, the end [trade node](/Trade_node "Trade node") of the English Channel provides significant income as the game progresses enabling a strong income to support peaceful colonial or military expansion.

England has a unique [government](/Government "Government") named the [English Monarchy](/Government#Unique_monarchy_types "Government") and suffers the historical political crisis of _War of the Roses_ fomenting during an interlude of the long-lasting _Hundred Years War_ against [![Flag of France](/images/thumb/d/de/France.png/20px-France.png)](/France "France") [France](/France "France"). The _English Monarchy_ has access to [Parliament](/Parliament "Parliament") which can vote on issues that provide special bonuses to the kingdom. However, Parliament requires seated [provinces](/Province "Province") to be bribed one way or another to pass issues, which can be a severe hindrance to the monarch. The _War of the Roses_ may determine whether or not England is able to resolve the _Hundred Years War_ over traditionally English territory in the continental Normandy, Gascony and Vasconia areas (bordering [![Flag of France](/images/thumb/d/de/France.png/20px-France.png)](/France "France") [France](/France "France")).

**Startup:** England starts the 1444 bookmark possessing 39 [provinces](/Provinces "Provinces"), 333 total [development](/Development "Development"), and is considered a [great power](/Great_power "Great power"). The King of England is _Henry VI of House Lancaster_ whose [skills](/Monarch_power "Monarch power") are _0 Adm/0 Dip/0 Mil._ England begins the game allied to [![Flag of Portugal](/images/thumb/1/12/Portugal.png/20px-Portugal.png)](/Portugal "Portugal") [Portugal](/Portugal "Portugal"). Besides its [primary culture](/Primary_culture "Primary culture"), England also accepts Gascon and Norman [cultures](/Culture "Culture"). The English Parliament is composed of 5 seats represented by London, Cambridge, Kent, Lancashire and Oxford provinces.

England starts in a very defensible position. Because of the sea separating the island from mainland Europe, the general inability of the AI to handle navies and England's high base development, they are in a favorable and well-defended starting position. After the War of the Roses and the Lollard Heresy events end, England is in a good spot to expand into the British islands, mainland Europe, or the many colonial areas. Additionally, the early-game "Surrender of Maine" event will almost certainly allow it to declare a Restoration of Union war on France. While this event may be used to get an early personal union over France without relying on the mission to do so, the war will be very difficult. England will be able to call in very few allies because of the short available time to build favors, and the War of Roses event will add an additional challenge to defeating France. The lollardy heresy can be avoided by the option to tolerate them, and I advise you should, since it will give you +1 tolerance of heretics. The papal influence is not useful as you will convert to Protestant/Anglican, and there will be no revolts.

### British Isles into British Napoleon Start\[[edit](/index.php?title=England&veaction=edit&section=7 "Edit section: British Isles into British Napoleon Start") | [edit source](/index.php?title=England&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: British Isles into British Napoleon Start")\]

Alternative Easy Strategy:

Game start: As of 1.30 "Austria" the Surrender Maine event will fire even if Maine is owned by a vassal. So starts the game selling Maine to Brittany, this may lead to France declaring reconquest war against them.

Rival Scotland and France +1 random, (not Castile so they aren't incentivized to ally France in case they don't rival each other), Ally Castile/Aragon/Austria. You can get Castile & Aragon sometimes even if they hate each other. If you are extremely lucky, you can ally Burgundy as well.

Wait. The Papacy is quite likely to excommunicate Provence, in which case Burgundy will at some point attack them, forcing France into a defensive war. This is when you would make your attack.

If Burgundy does not declare war early, don't worry. You have all the time in the world to resolve the War of Roses, and to subjugate Scotland.

Notes for War of Roses: - the criteria for a successful resolution requires +1 Stab, no rebel controlled provinces, and an heir. If you want to speed up the process of getting an heir, you can hold off on sending marriage agreements at the beginning of the game. This is because a marriage agreement increases the probability of getting a consort, otherwise you are left waiting for a local marriage to pop or forced to go over your relation limit.

Notes for Scottish Subjugation. - Doing this before declaring war against France nets you some Power Projection - Wait for manpower to reach 60%, and then use all the English trade money to buy mercs to 100% Force Limit. Take the mission. Declare on Scotland. If you can get allies into the war, you don't need to worry about France. If your allies can kill enough French troops, Burgundy will be more likely to declare on France. - Later when you are Tech 10, you can always Seize Land from Scotland until they are under the required city limit for the Diplomatic Formation of GB

  
First French Attack: Before you attack, release Gascony and declare a reconquest war for the Gascon Cores. When you win this war, France will be neutered and should be easy pickings for a PU claim. I personally always take Gascon cores, wait for another war to take Paris and some forts, and then take the PU mission (just to be safe around the time limit of the PU Casus Belli). If you are careful and good with time, you could probably do it in fewer wars.

Conquering Ireland. Just kill them all at the same time, or in very quick succession, only pausing so that you don't go over 100% overextension.

Aggressive Expansion Improve relations with the North Western HRE countries to avoid Coalition (this can be done when you are waiting for the War of the Roses. Important countries are Utrecht, East Friesland, Liege, Nevers etc etc.)

Ideas:

These depend on what you want to do. If you are trying to PU Spain, you might consider Influence. If you want to fight a bunch of land wars, a military idea is possible.

You almost always want Colonization so that you can get access to the India subcontinent & Southern Asia early. But if you do this, you probably want Religious as well so you have the religious Casus. Admin is also a serious consideration. In this case, you will probably have to cut Expansion, and won't have space for an early military idea.

### Bringing France to Heel - Surrender of Maine\[[edit](/index.php?title=England&veaction=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Bringing France to Heel - Surrender of Maine") | [edit source](/index.php?title=England&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Bringing France to Heel - Surrender of Maine")\]

The "Surrender of Maine" event, which will almost certainly occur within the first few years of the game, will force you to choose between handing over the province of Maine or declaring a "Restoration of Union" war with France. The riskiest, but most rewarding, approach will be to roundly defeat France and bring them in as Junior Partner.

In the 1.33 version France does not invade England anymore as this is not the war goal. This forces you to take the initiative.

#### Cancelling forts\[[edit](/index.php?title=England&veaction=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Cancelling forts") | [edit source](/index.php?title=England&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Cancelling forts")\]

Even before the event happens, it's worth to destroy all England's forts on the continent. In the beginning of the war England must take down Scotland first to keep the homeland safe and these forts would fall into French hands anyway before Scotland is handled. Occupied forts provide higher war score to France and to siege them back is much harder than to take the province without a fort. Labourd's fort can be kept as a barrier between France and player's potential war-ally Castile. Coordinated approach from Castile's land is advised to keep Castile in the war as long as possible - leaving Castile alone against France can cause an early separate peace.

##### Dealing with aggressive expansion\[[edit](/index.php?title=England&veaction=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Dealing with aggressive expansion") | [edit source](/index.php?title=England&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Dealing with aggressive expansion")\]

Forcing of union in a peace deal will provide a lot of aggressive expansion. Either way (with some luck) is to wait until Burgundy declares war on France/Provence and takes some land from France in peace deal what causes a reduction in France's size. Usually it is enough when Burgundy takes just 1 province to reduce the aggressive expansion under a coalition threat (if France still has only the initial game's number of provinces). Other way is to end the War of the Roses and click on complete its mission shortly before the peace which provides -10% aggressive expansion bonus which should decrease potential coalition members to zero. Important is not to take any land from French allies in separate peace, only to cripple them by non-aggressive means - reparations, money, etc. especially Scotland. If the AE reduction bonus is taken as late as possible and the separate peace with Scotland was taken early, the bonus can be used in next war for subjugation of Scotland and conquest of Ireland. French liberty desire will be immense, so diplomat must start to improve relations immediately. Support loyalist provides -20% liberty desire too.

Occupying Paris (or successfully subjugating France as a whole) will grant England permanent claims on Brittany and the Ile-de-France area; conquering Brittany, in turn, will grant claims on most if not all other French territory. Follow the mission tree along those lines and you should be able to chip away at France until it's annexed or irrelevant.

At this moment, England should have secured a major foothold on continental Europe and can now look to expand south into the Iberian Peninsula or east into [![Flag of Burgundy](/images/thumb/b/b0/Burgundy.png/20px-Burgundy.png)](/Burgundy "Burgundy") [Burgundy](/Burgundy "Burgundy") and the [![Flag of Holy Roman Empire](/images/thumb/e/ee/Holy_Roman_Empire.png/20px-Holy_Roman_Empire.png)](/Holy_Roman_Empire "Holy Roman Empire") [Holy Roman Empire](/Holy_Roman_Empire "Holy Roman Empire"). Special interest should be given to the lands inside the English Channel trade node, as this will provide England with a large boost to trade income.

Recommended idea groups are _Influence_ and _Offensive_ as these will enable less expensive integration of vassals and help counter the strength of any opposing armies.

Another option would be to cede the province of Maine to [![Flag of Provence](/images/thumb/b/bd/Provence.png/20px-Provence.png)](/Provence "Provence") [Provence](/Provence "Provence") And the more legitimate one considering the above is about to be broken with the Emperor DLC, and patch. This path, in turn causes France to drop his alliance with Provence, leaving the minor with the high likelyhood of only having one other minor to protect it. A war with Provence that lasts until the 1450 event drop date, can net you Maine and Anjou. And Provence is likely to be quickly swarmed over by Burgundy and the Papal State in most games, Which if you vassalize Provence after at least Burgundy is done with them, you get a vassal with cores on at least 3 provinces in addition to what they hold when you vassalize them. If the Papal State has excommunicated them, it makes this peace deal all the cheaper, and possibly can allow you to vassalize what is left of [![Flag of Lorraine](/images/thumb/2/21/Lorraine.png/20px-Lorraine.png)](/Lorraine "Lorraine") [Lorraine](/Lorraine "Lorraine") as well, provided that the Papal State hasn't either declared their war or gotten far enough to stop you.

### Uniting the isles\[[edit](/index.php?title=England&veaction=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Uniting the isles") | [edit source](/index.php?title=England&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Uniting the isles")\]

The rest of the British Isles is composed of [![Flag of Scotland](/images/thumb/2/27/Scotland.png/20px-Scotland.png)](/Scotland "Scotland") [Scotland](/Scotland "Scotland") and several small Irish nations. Conquering the rest of the British Isles approximately doubles development of England and thus is a common game opener. At the start of the game, none of the nations can challenge England's army or navy and the Irish are generally busy conquering their rivaling minors. By building up a decent active military and manpower reserve (which is almost guaranteed to happen in normal play, regardless), England can complete the "Levy the Troops" mission to get permanent claims on Ireland and the majority of Scotland. It will also get a _time-sensitive_ Subjugation CB on Scotland; using this to vassalize the Scots will require a bit more forethought than slowly chipping away at the north (as it will generate a good deal of Aggressive Expansion, as well as resulting in a very angry vassal), but will save on time and admin power in the long term by enabling the _Form Great Britain Diplomatically_ decision. Since this CB is time-sensitive, it's recommended not to complete the mission immediately but wait until you're ready to use the CB.

Ireland is usually a trivial affair once you have the necessary claims, as the local minors fight among themselves and struggle to find powerful allies or guarantors. Because of their distance from mainland Europe, conquering these counts will rarely cause too much AE to build up, so the only real limiting factors are administrative power and your other priorities. If one or two of the minors start consolidating power, however, you may find it worthwhile to start expanding earlier than planned so that they don't get the chance to become a nuisance. You can save on administrative power and use diplomatic power instead by vassalizing one of the Irish minors and feeding them Irish land, then diplo-annexing them.

What remains is to take care of [![Flag of Scotland](/images/thumb/2/27/Scotland.png/20px-Scotland.png)](/Scotland "Scotland") [Scotland](/Scotland "Scotland"), which will usually be allied with or [![Guaranteed.png](/images/thumb/5/51/Guaranteed.png/28px-Guaranteed.png)](/File:Guaranteed.png)[guaranteed](/Diplomacy "Diplomacy") by [![Flag of France](/images/thumb/d/de/France.png/20px-France.png)](/France "France") [France](/France "France") (unless France has already been eliminated). Triggering a war with Scotland generally has severe consequences on continental Europe and England has to be careful of losing its foothold in the French region. However, these relationships can be looked at with trepidation or with opportunity. One example of utilizing the special relationship between France and Scotland is to start wars with Scotland as an excuse to take territory and [![Power projection.png](/images/8/8b/Power_projection.png)](/Power_projection "Power projection") [power projection](/Power_projection "Power projection") from France. This method means slow going as the provinces can be twice as expensive and the strategy requires strong allies on the continent, as well as giving a larger amount of aggressive expansion. Another way of dealing with Scotland is by declaring war on an Irish minor allied to Scotland and then making them a co-belligerent. This will allow the player to take the entirety of Scotland in a single war.

### Colonial Britain\[[edit](/index.php?title=England&veaction=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Colonial Britain") | [edit source](/index.php?title=England&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Colonial Britain")\]

Colonial England generally is a more defensive choice as it doesn't require direct conflict with continental Europe until later into the game. In this variation securing a strong economic base is vital to rapid colonization. One method is to conquer Scotland using the previously mentioned strategy of declaring war on one of the Irish minors allied with Scotland and including Scotland into the war as a co-belligerent. This will prevent a struggle with France.

#### Increasing early colonial range\[[edit](/index.php?title=England&veaction=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Increasing early colonial range") | [edit source](/index.php?title=England&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Increasing early colonial range")\]

The challenge with an England centered colonization campaign is that they struggle to reach colonial regions until later technologies. A helpful way to increase England's [![Colonial range.png](/images/thumb/f/f5/Colonial_range.png/28px-Colonial_range.png)](/Colonial_range "Colonial range") colonial range is to look toward neighboring [![Flag of Norway](/images/thumb/0/0f/Norway.png/20px-Norway.png)](/Norway "Norway") [Norway](/Norway "Norway") and its Icelandic provinces and hiring a colonial advisor. Norway has a few neighboring provinces to the British isles. England can get involved in a war with their suzerain, [![Flag of Denmark](/images/thumb/6/69/Denmark.png/20px-Denmark.png)](/Denmark "Denmark") [Denmark](/Denmark "Denmark"), by supporting the independence of [![Flag of Sweden](/images/thumb/9/98/Sweden.png/20px-Sweden.png)](/Sweden "Sweden") [Sweden](/Sweden "Sweden"). An advantage to pursuing colonization through a northern strategy is that it confines England to the Northern portion of the Americas, away from the likely Iberian colonies in South America.

A second way to increase colonial range is through conquest of parts of the Iberian Peninsula. Early fabrication of claims and rivaling of Castile can enable the release of potential vassals like [![Flag of León](/images/thumb/f/f8/Le%C3%B3n.png/20px-Le%C3%B3n.png)](/Le%C3%B3n "León") [León](/Le%C3%B3n "León") ([![Colonists.png](/images/thumb/3/34/Colonists.png/28px-Colonists.png)](/Colonist "Colonist")**+1** colonist as level 4 national idea) and securing the provinces of Galicia and The Canaries to put England closer to the colonizable regions of Africa and South America. Notably this method puts England in direct conflict for colonies with ally [![Flag of Portugal](/images/thumb/1/12/Portugal.png/20px-Portugal.png)](/Portugal "Portugal") [Portugal](/Portugal "Portugal") and now rival [![Flag of Castile](/images/thumb/e/ee/Castile.png/20px-Castile.png)](/Castile "Castile") [Castile](/Castile "Castile").

Recommended idea groups for this direction are _Exploration_ and _Expansion_.
