This website is a wiki, meaning that anyone can edit any unprotected page and improve articles immediately for all readers. You do not need to register to do this. Anyone who has edited is known as a "[Wikipedian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedian "wikipedia:Wikipedian")" and, no matter how trivial the edit may seem, can be proud that he or she has helped make the EUIV Wiki what it is. All of these edits add up!

Editing\[[edit source](/index.php?title=Help:Editing&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Editing")\]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Editing most wiki pages is simple. Simply click on the "**edit**" tab at the top of an article. This will bring you to a new page with a containing the editable text of the current page.

In this box, you can type in the text that you want to add, using wiki markup to format the text and add other elements like images and tables. The toolbar above the text box can help with formatting. A quick reference to wiki markup can be opened by clicking 'Help' in this toolbar.

Never start a line with a leading space unless you want the special formatting it causes. Paragraphs can be separated with a blank line.

When you have finished editing, you should write a short edit summary in the small field below the edit-box. You may use shorthand to describe your changes. To see how the page looks with your edits, press the "**Show preview**" button. To see the differences between the page with your edits and the previous version of the page, press the "**Show changes**" button. If you're satisfied with what you see, **be bold** and press the "**Save page**" button. Your changes will immediately be visible to all EU4 Wiki users.

### Talk (discussion) pages\[[edit source](/index.php?title=Help:Editing&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Talk (discussion) pages")\]

Talk pages are similar to articles in that they also have a "new section" tab to start a new section or edit the whole page.

### Minor edits\[[edit source](/index.php?title=Help:Editing&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Minor edits")\]

A check to the "minor edit" box signifies that only superficial differences exist between the version with your edit and the previous version: typo corrections, formatting and presentation changes, rearranging of text without modifying content, etc. A _minor edit_ is a version that the editor believes requires no review and could never be the subject of a dispute. The "minor edit" option is one of several options available only to registered users.

### Major edits\[[edit source](/index.php?title=Help:Editing&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Major edits")\]

All editors are encouraged to be bold, but there are several things that a user can do to ensure that major edits are performed smoothly. Before engaging in a major edit, a user should consider discussing proposed changes on the article discussion/talk page. Once the edit has been completed, the inclusion of an edit summary will assist in documenting the changes. These steps will help all to ensure that major edits are well received by the Wikipedia community.

A major edit should be reviewed to confirm that it is consensual to all concerned editors. Therefore, any change that affects the _meaning_ of an article is major (not minor), even if the edit is a single word.

There are no necessary terms to which you have to agree when doing major edits, but the recommendations above have become best practice. If you do it your own way, the likelihood of your edits being reedited may be higher.

When performing a large edit, it is suggested you periodically, and before pressing 'save page', copy your edits into an external text editor (preferably one without formatting, such as Notepad. This ensures that in the case of a browser crash you will not lose your work. If you are adding substantial amounts of work, it is also a good idea to save changes in stages.

Wiki markup\[[edit source](/index.php?title=Help:Editing&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Wiki markup")\]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wiki markup is the information not displayed on the finished article. Wiki markup is only visible in the edit section and instructs the MediaWiki software on the display of the article. A basic list of Wiki markup can be found on the help button above the toolbar.
