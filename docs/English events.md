_Lollards were a heretical group following the theological teaching of John Wycliffe. Popular protests against the wealth, power, and pride of the clergy, were frequent, and in times of disorder would express themselves in an extreme form. They had been persecuted several times during the 14th century, and their last appearance was in the early 15th century._

_The Hundred Years War was the last great medieval war. It was a war not just between kings, but lesser nobles were also able to pursue their own personal agendas while participating in the larger conflict. Future wars saw far less factionalism, at least on the scale found in medieval conflicts. The Hundred Years War was actually dozens of little wars and hundreds of battles and sieges that went on for over a century, between 1337 and 1453, until both sides were exhausted. While neither side won in any real sense, the end result was that while there were two kingdoms at the beginning of the war, there were two nations at the end of it._

_The position of Justice of the Peace originated in England in about the 12th Century, believed to be from a Royal Edict issued by King Richard I and the Archbishop of Canterbury in the year 1195. The title was first known as Custodes Pacis, but was later changed to Justices of the Peace. An act concerning Justices of the Peace was passed in 1489. It required that justices devote part of every quarter session to acknowledgment of the areas in which they themselves are particularly weak. The same act provided the general populace with the right to complain about the actions of justices directly to the monarch or his council. The appointment of the justices by the Lord Chancellor at irregular annual intervals allowed for the possible removal of uncooperative gentlemen at the next annual re-issue of the commissions._

_The Court of Star Chamber was a court of law which evolved from meetings of the king's royal council. Although its roots go back to the medieval period, the court only became powerful as a separate entity during the reign of Henry VII. In 1487 the court became a judicial body separate from the king's council, with a mandate to hear petitions of redress. The Court of Star Chamber was named for the star pattern painted on the ceiling of the room at Westminster Palace where its meetings were held. In a sense the court was a supervisory body._

_The population of England lived on the land under a manorial system. They were primarily tenant farmers who were tied to a particular locality, rarely if ever leaving their places of birth. With the rise of commerce, it became increasingly profitable for the aristocracy who owned the land to enclose it. The enclosure movement displaced the tenant farmers and caused a movement into the cities. As people congregated in cities, they became a source of cheap labor for the factories and mines that developed. The concentration of population into cities, however, also created a class of poor, many of whom were willing to became 'indentured servants' and migrate to the North American colonies in search of a better life._

He had his divorce granted in 1533 and married the lady-in-waiting Ann Boleyn. Altogether, Henry VIII contracted 6 marriages._

_As the granddaughter of King Henry VIII's elder sister Mary, Lady Jane Grey had a claim to the English throne. Married against her will in 1553 to Lord Guildford Dudley, son of the Duke of Northumberland, she was used as a pawn by Northumberland, who was King Edward VI's regent, in his determined effort to retain his power after the king's death. King Edward VI was deadly sick and during his last illness Northumberland had him sign a 'device' excluding Henry VIII's daughters, the future queens Mary I and Elizabeth I, from the throne in favor of Jane. On July 10, 1553, four days after Edward's death, Jane was proclaimed queen. Her reign lasted only until July 19. The country supported the Catholic Mary's claim, and Northumberland's forces were dispersed by troops loyal to Mary._

_In 1554 the Catholic Queen Mary married Felipe of Spain, a union that opened great possibilities for both England and Spain. Felipe was granted the title of King of England by Parliament, but was not allowed to govern the country. But the imminent question of importance was over religion. The Act of Supremacy had given clerical control to the monarch, but the people of England were sundered over religion. Catholics demanded papal authority, while Protestants wanted liberal clerical laws. Mary chose to throw in her lot with the fanatical Catholics, and a wave of terror commenced, earning her the nickname 'Bloody Mary'._

_Queen Elizabeth I sought to bring about a religious settlement with the objective of establishing in England a Protestant Anglican Church with herself as the Supreme Governor. Things began to fray around the edges when Mary Queen of Scots fled to England. The problem for Elizabeth I was that Mary was a Catholic claimant to the English throne. Elizabeth I had Mary locked away in various castles, but she still became the center of numerous conspiracies to overthrow the upstarts who had displaced the ancient aristocracy. Their basic idea was to marry Mary to Norfolk, England's only Duke. This combination represented a serious threat to Elizabeth I but Norfolk seemed undecided and continued to delay until Elizabeth I invited him to London whereupon she locked him in the Tower. Elizabeth I suspected that the Earls of Northumberland, Westmorland and Cumberland were involved in the conspiracy and invited them to London as well. The Earls guessed their accommodation would be the Tower and opted instead for a rebellion which began at about midnight on the 9 November 1569. The Catholic faith had survived in the North and there was real resentment against the extension of Tudor domination and Elizabeth I's new men. The Earl of Northumberland mustered his troops in Richmond on the 16 November. Sir George was appointed provost marshal and martial law was declared. Elizabeth I ordered that 700 of the riffraff be executed, 200 of these were to be from or around Richmond. How many were actually executed is not known but seemingly it was a smaller number, perhaps around 57, 12 of whom were from Richmond. The decade after the Rebellion was a difficult period for Catholics who faced constant persecution. Religious meetings were held in secret, away from the eyes of unfriendly informants. It seems, however, that the few gentry who were accused in court of holding Catholic beliefs were the 'mere tip of a great pyramid' which represented a hidden underground movement._

_Hugh O'Neill lived in England in the 1560s. He served the government in the 1580s but in 1594 rebelled. Dissatisfied with the English government's persistent policy of playing the chiefs against one another, O'Neill was also angered by the English refusal to restore the lands granted to his grandfather. At last he formed an alliance with the other Irish chiefs and sought aid against Protestant England from Catholic Spain. He achieved something like unity among his allies and, after 1595, defeated some of Queen Elizabeth's best commanders in Ireland. O'Neill was defeated while attempting to join a Spanish force that arrived at Kinsale in 1601. His Irish allies dispersed, and O'Neill retreated to Ulster. In 1603 he made peace with the English, surrendering his tribal authority. King James I later pardoned him._

_The 16th century saw the number of members in the House of Commons increase, while the House of Lords remained significantly smaller. The power base in Parliament shifted to the House of Commons who were well aware of the fact. Elizabeth I had a mix of determination, majestic presence and kindness towards the members of Parliament that her successors Jacob I and his son Charles I did not. The Parliament wanted to have more say in matters of the Church, justice and taxes to which the King naturally was opposed. When Jacob I tried to propose marriage of his son to a Spanish, and later a French princess (both Catholic) they had enough. The Parliament of 1628 voiced the Petition of Right which forbade arrests and taxation ordered by the King. In 1629 the Parliament voted for resolutions to condemn Religious and Tax politics and the King opposed the Parliament and tried to dissolve it. Eleven years of Dictatorship ensued. In 1642 the Civil War divided the country into Cavaliers (Royalists) versus Roundheads (the Parliament's wigless)._

_Charles II was secretly Catholic and his brother James II openly. The Decree of Indulgence issued in 1672 was aimed at relieving the situation for dissenters and Catholics. In addition to personal reasons, any king who supported Catholicism could count on the support from France. In fact, Charles II got his reward in form of a large sum of money in a Treaty closed behind the back of the Parliament. Around the same time Parliament issued the Bill of Test which again excluded dissenting religious groups (including Catholics) from public offices and allowed persecution. The Parliament subsequently raised the issue of excluding the openly Catholic James II from succession rights._

_This rebellion of the Jacobite cause led by the Earl of Mar began in 1715. By the end of September, most of the Highlands were in his control and his army numbered some 5,000 with more appearing daily. But all this was done without even notifying the King they were claiming to support. The Old Pretender, King James III, was not even aware of the situation as of yet. Word was sent to the King, and the size of the force continued to grow. The Earl, with his growing army, moved to Perth and established his base there after taking the city. Meanwhile another Jacobite army was forming to the south, The Old Pretender hearing the news began to make preparations for his trip to Scotland and his crowning. By early November, the northern Jacobite army numbered some 12,000, mostly Clansmen from the Highlands. The Earl then decided to march south where he soon met the army of the Duke of Argyll, the only remaining government troops in Scotland. The Jacobite forces were mismanaged and split. The southern army marched south to raise Lancashire instead of turning on the Duke of Argyll's flank, while a much smaller force under the Duke defeated the larger northern army of the Jacobites at Sheriffmuir on November 13th. The southern army was also met and defeated at Preston by other government forces in England. The Jacobites were forced to retreat to Perth, while still waiting for their leader to arrive. The Old Pretender finally arrived in Scotland on the 22nd of December after leaving fittingly enough from Dunkirk. But the matter was already settled, as the Duke of Argyll was already receiving reinforcements of experienced troops and was preparing an overwhelming force to march north. The King, James III, was again forced to retreat after spending a dismal six weeks in Scotland._

_The War of Jenkins's Ear (which merged into the War of the Austrian Succession) was the result, amongst other things, of a minor, alleged confrontation between Spanish Guarda Costas and the Captain and crew of the Glasgow brig 'Rebecca' in 1731. Captain Jenkins claimed that, whilst in the Caribbean, his ship had been boarded by the Guarda Costa and his crew maltreated, and that the Spaniards had then cut off one of his ears. Additionally, he claimed he was tortured and threatened with death. There were no major actions fought during this war, although the declaration of war led to the dispatch of Anson's squadron to attack the coast of South America, and to finally circumnavigate the globe, and Admiral Edward Vernon's fleet attacked Spanish territory in the Caribbean._

_In 1745, the war of the Austrian Succession was raging in Europe. England had most of her troops busy in the Austrian Netherlands. The time seemed ripe for Charles-Edward Stuart (1720-1788) to boldly land in Scotland. He and his Jacobite supporters managed to beat an English army at Prestonpans on October 2nd, 1745 and entered Edinburgh where he had his father James recognized as King of Scotland. At the head of a small army, he then invaded England as far as Derby, but had to retreat when promised French support did not materialize (the intended landing of French troops had failed). Caught up by the British army under Cumberland (recalled from the Low Countries), he was soundly defeated at Culloden on 16th April, 1746. This was the best shot the Stuarts ever got to reclaim the throne, but the rash young prince did not listen to the sober advice of his Generals, thus forever burying the Stuart cause._

_John Methuen was born in 1650. An accomplished diplomat, he is well remembered for the treaty signed in 1703 between England and Portugal. The main purpose of the treaty was to allow free introduction of English wool and cloths to Portugal in exchange of free entry of Portuguese wine into England (Port wine). The treaty made in effect Portugal an economic and political satellite of England, and was abrogated only in 1836. John Methuen died in 1706 shortly after his greatest success._

_Cromwell, Lord Protector of the English Commonwealth, promulgated the Act of Navigation in 1651. It was mostly directed against the Dutch carrier trade and provided that all goods shipped to and from England was to be transported on English ships, while also confirming the colonial exclusive policy. The Act directly caused the first English-Dutch war of 1652-1654 and the second in 1665-1667. At the Peace of Breda (1667), New Amsterdam (New York) was exchanged for Surinam (Dutch Guiana) and the Act slightly modified. It nevertheless contributed to the enormous growth in English naval and colonial trade._

This stability was preponderant in the slowly but constantly increasing domination of the world economy by Great Britain in the 18th and 19th centuries.

Back to power in 1766-1778 despite his poor health, he advocated war against France in 1778._

_William Pitt was the second son of William Pitt, 1st earl of Chatham. In December 1783, King George III took the opportunity to dismiss the coalition and asked the 24-year-old Pitt to form a government. When Parliament reassembled in January 1784, the government was at once defeated by 39 votes on a virtual motion of censure, but Pitt refused to resign, and gradually the coalition's majority in Parliament began to crumble. By March 8 the majority against him was one vote, and on March 25 Parliament was dissolved. In 1788 he signed the Triple Alliance between Britain, Prussia, and Holland, thereby ensuring that in a future war his country would not be bereft of allies as it had been during the American Revolution. In 1790 he demonstrated Britain's renewed power and prestige by negotiating a peace between Austria and Turkey. In 1784 he passed his own India Act, creating a board of control regulating Indian affairs and the East India Company. Finally, in 1791 the Canada Constitutional Act was passed. London became responsible for the government of both Lower and Upper Canada, but both provinces were given representative assemblies._

_English poet, dramatist and actor William Shakespeare is often called the English national poet and considered by many to be the greatest dramatist of all time. His plays written in the late 16th and early 17th centuries for a small repertory theater are now performed and read more often and in more countries than ever before. The prophecy of his great contemporary, the poet and dramatist Ben Jonson, that Shakespeare 'was not of an age but for all time' has been fulfilled._

_A few years prior to the Revolution, a âGreat Reform Actâ was passed by the old government which specified that only male persons may hold the right to vote, actively undermining the rights held by landowning noblewomen. Led by these disgruntled upper-class ladies, women both poor and rich took to the streets during the Revolution, marching together under the newly formed Regiment of Revolutionary \[Root.GetAdjective\] Women. Their marching chant âvotes for women, step in time!â was sung in triumphant chorus throughout the streets of \[Root.Capital.GetCapitalName\] as the old government was utterly smashed by our forces. Even the most conservative amidst the Revolutionary Council cannot deny the vital role these ladies played in securing our rule of the Isles and the impact their liberal spirit has had on our national identity.

### ![Msg event.png](/images/4/4e/Msg_event.png)The East India Company

_Created two years before its Dutch equivalent, the English East India Company had a difficult start. Its first trading posts in the Moluccas (Amboina) and Indonesia were soon overwhelmed and closed by the Dutch and activity concentrated to India (Madras, Bombay, Calcutta). It is there that she would know its greatest success, from a small trading ventures of harbor factories to the large Indian Empire build by Warren Hastings and Robert Clive (from 1757 onwards) that would control most of the Indian subcontinent. The company would outlast all its competitors and would only be taken over by the British government in 1867, in the wake of the great Sepoy revolt of 1857._

### ![Msg event.png](/images/4/4e/Msg_event.png)The Globe Theatre

_Theater and the arts are spreading through our population, and people in the cities enjoy a variety of entertainment. As promoters and developers of art as we are, we are proud to inaugurate a new theater in the middle of \[Root.Capital.GetCapitalName\]. It is actually a reconstruction of another one, called just 'The Theatre' which was in fact the first permanent theater in all England. Its beams have been transported to the new site and reused to build this new theater, which is larger and more splendorous than the one it replaces.  
  
With this new theater, our people will be able to enjoy many more plays, including the ones of the acclaimed William Shakespeare, and even our \[Root.Monarch.GetTitle\] \[Root.Monarch.GetName\] has shown interest in attending some of its performances._

### ![Msg event.png](/images/4/4e/Msg_event.png)Henry VIII

_Being the third child of the previous king, young Henry wasn't expected to inherit the throne. As such, he received first-rate education, and some minor titles in the kingdom since very young to allow internal stability and disfavor the sharing of titles among other established families. A true intellectual, writing in English, French and Latin, he became the image of a Renaissance Man. Also with an avid interest for music, he could play a variety of instruments and sing.  
  
Although not being formally trained for rulership, his well-developed education and his skills in foreign relations and diplomacy, together with his enormous charisma could definitely make him into one of the best rulers England has ever seen._

### ![Msg event.png](/images/4/4e/Msg_event.png)The Elizabethan Era

_Being initially considered heir presumptive, she was later considered illegitimate and removed from the line of succession after her mother was executed when Elizabeth was two years old. Having the finest education, she could write English, Latin, Italian, French and Greek. The controversy in the succession after the death of Elizabeth's half-brother was resolved when she and her half-sister Mary jointly rode triumphally into London. However, their bond did not last long, as Mary was a devout Catholic determined to extinguish the Protestant faith, in which Elizabeth had been educated, and she even spent almost a year in prison suspected of supporting Protestant rebels against Mary.  
  
Having one of the best educations, as well as a gentle demeanor, she can without doubt become one of the best rulers England ever had, ushering the dawn of the greatest golden age ever seen._

_The Reformation has abolished the traditional Latin Mass. Instead, the heretic Christians hold their prayers in their native language, defying the will of the Catholic Church in the process. Through considerable persecution and burning of the members of the Reformation, this practice has been stomped out by the \[Root.GetAdjective\] soldiers at the command of \[Root.Monarch.GetTitle\] \[Root.Monarch.GetName\] and the Mass is held in Latin once again._

### ![Msg event.png](/images/4/4e/Msg_event.png)Strife between \[Root.Monarch.GetTitle\] and \[Root.GetParliamentOrFallbackName\]

_The relations between \[Root.Monarch.GetTitle\] \[Root.Monarch.GetName\] and the \[Root.GetParliamentOrFallbackName\] have always oscillated between cordial and strained. Differences between the various regional interests and the authority of the \[Root.Monarch.GetTitle\] have always been cause for heated debates, and the different views on religion have also sparked their own share of discussions. Recently, these disagreements took a new turn, when some members of the \[Root.GetParliamentOrFallbackName\] tried to defend their positions in front of the \[Root.Monarch.GetTitle\] speaking too fervently in a manner truly unbecoming of persons of such high status. The \[Root.Monarch.GetTitle\] was obviously displeased about the way the issue was being presented, and \[Root.Monarch.GetSheHe\] turned it down immediately.  
  
That resulted in the issue being settled for now, but increased the ardor of its supporters and their animosity towards the \[Root.Monarch.GetTitle\]. Not only that, it also seems that the people willing to take the issue into consideration has surprisingly increased, and there are more people offering it their support, whether openly or behind closed doors. In addition, other groups are also using this issue as a justification of the inability of the \[Root.Monarch.GetTitle\] to properly address regional concerns.  
  
They argue that if a single issue like that was not even considered, none of their own issues and demands will be heard. As such, they advocate that the \[Root.Monarch.GetTitle\] should not interfere with the decisions of the \[Root.GetParliamentOrFallbackName\], while \[Root.Monarch.GetTitle\] \[Root.Monarch.GetName\] \[Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself\] wishes to limit the \[Root.GetParliamentOrFallbackName\]'s interference to \[Root.Monarch.GetHerHis\] rule._

### ![Msg event.png](/images/4/4e/Msg_event.png)The Conflict Escalates

_Tensions between the \[Root.GetParliamentOrFallbackName\] and the \[Root.Monarch.GetTitle\] have escalated to a point of no return. What started as a mere dispute over the support towards regional interests, taxation, and military expenditure has turned into a conflict over the role of the \[Root.GetParliamentOrFallbackName\] itself in the government. There are questions about the necessity of a \[Root.GetParliamentOrFallbackName\] on one side, and the necessity of a \[Root.Monarch.GetTitle\] on the other. \[Root.Monarch.GetTitle\] \[Root.Monarch.GetName\] is tired of having to keep content a group of people that keep interfering in \[Root.Monarch.GetHerHis\] legitimate and undeniable right to rule and uses every opportunity to mine their authority. On the other hand, regional powerful individuals of the \[Root.GetParliamentOrFallbackName\] have proclaimed that they will no longer obey any central and tyrannical authority, and have raised troops in their territories to defend their own authority by force.  
  
Great parts of our country have declared themselves as no longer subjected to our rule and are in open rebellion against us._

### ![Msg event.png](/images/4/4e/Msg_event.png)Bloody Mary

_Through the search of a male heir, she was disfavored from the line of succession in favor of her half-brother, being sent instead to Wales, making her relationship with his father deteriorate during her teenage years because of that. During the reign of his half-brother, being she a devout Catholic, he would further disfavor her from the succession in fear that she would reverse the Protestant reforms that had taken place during his reign. That is in fact what Mary wanted to do, determined to crush the Protestant faith, and together with her half-sister Elizabeth, she aimed to gather enough support to reclaim the title of queen.  
  
Despite the odds and the court opposition, she could make a great ruler, reverting the Protestant tendencies that the kingdom has adopted recently and converting it back to Catholicism._

### ![Msg event.png](/images/4/4e/Msg_event.png)Order of Chivalry

_Several military orders were founded during the first Crusades. Borrowing from that idea, and paired with the concepts of chivalry, many other orders have been established in a courtly fashion. They include the idea of confraternity, and are associated with both merit and prestige, as well as the appropriate medals and distinctions. Some of them are also tied to a particular noble family, or even endorsed by royal patronage, be it foreign or our own.  
  
Some voices proclaim these kinds of orders are already a thing of the past, whereas others claim that chivalry, merit and values should always be lauded and rewarded. Our nation has always been in favor of worthy individuals, and the values proponed by the orders are for sure something to be upheld. As such, our country will benefit greatly from an order of chivalry promoted and endorsed by our \[Root.Monarch.GetTitle\] to last for generations, representing the best values of our nation and formed by the best individuals it can offer._

### ![Msg event.png](/images/4/4e/Msg_event.png)Jousting in England

_Jousting has been a tradition in all Europe for centuries, allowing knights to display and hone their combat abilities. In recent years, jousting has been improved and perfected, with innovations such as the introduction of the tilt barrier. Its purpose is to prevent collisions and to keep both riders at an optimal angle when breaking the lance. Improvements in armor technology have also led to better safety for the combatants. As a result, jousting has become more an entertainment and spectacle rather than an actual martial exercise. However, it also means that more people than ever before are able to participate in them._

### ![Msg event.png](/images/4/4e/Msg_event.png)The Fifth Monarchists

_The Fifth Monarchists is the name of a Protestant sect centered around the belief that four monarchies would precede the final fifth one, which is the establishment of the Kingdom of God on Earth. They claim that the recent events signaled the end of the Fourth Monarchy, and that the rule of \[Root.Monarch.GetTitle\] \[Root.Monarch.GetName\] is actually preventing the coming of the Fifth. They consider themselves 'saved' and call themselves 'saints', acting allegedly with the intent of preparing the population for the Second Coming. Although not really a major movement, their big enough reach combined with the fact that some of its members believe that military action is justified, make them into a group impossible to ignore.  
  
Despite being extreme, it is undeniable that their beliefs have already picked the interest of some very powerful and influential members of the government, whether openly or in secret. It will be unwise to just ignore them, specially if there's actually the possibility that the Second Coming might truly be upon us._

### ![Msg event.png](/images/4/4e/Msg_event.png)The End of the Fifth Monarchists

![Event trigger.png](/images/3/35/Event_trigger.png) **The description below is one of several available for this event.**  

_The following description is used if:_

*   At least one of:
    *   None of:
        *   Has enacted the _âFifth Monarchists Regimeâ_ government reform
    *   Country flag fifth\_monarchists\_have\_failed is set

_The tides and ebbs of the government are ever flowing, and the ones to be favored for a time are soon or later sure to lose that favor and be removed from that position. This has happened to us too, and the Fifth Monarchists have seen their previous favor vanish as the currents of the masses have changed their flow.  
  
A chapter in the history of our country has closed. History will be the one to judge us for it, but regardless of it being for better or for worse, the Fifth Monarchists are no longer the ones to lead us. All hail the new \[Root.Monarch.GetTitle\] \[Root.Monarch.GetName\]._

The following description is used if:

*   Has enacted the _âFifth Monarchists Regimeâ_ government reform
*   None of:
    *   Country flag fifth\_monarchists\_have\_failed is set

_We all followed the overwhelming tide of the Fifth Monarchists, being swept away by their calling of the Second Coming. They were preparing the country for it, for the Kingdom of God in the Earth. We were all expectant, awaiting the day Jesus would come down from the heavens and we would be blissfully reunited with Him.  
  
But that day didn't come.  
  
What came first were the excuses. Justifications due to calculation errors. Then the promises. Promises of it actually being the next day, and then the next day, and the next one. People started not believing the words of those that had led them there. They started opening their eyes and realizing that they were not 'saints', that they were not going to be 'saved'. Jesus was not coming down from heaven, at least not yet.  
  
What started as disbelief quickly turned into hate towards the ones that had misguided them. The masses stormed the government buildings, dragging out the leaders that not long ago they had followed. They were dragged out of their offices and into public squares, and then condemned, criticized and accused. Finally, in most cases they were executed, imprisoned the rest. None could escape the ire of the vengeful masses.''_

_The Holy Roman Empire has seen its fair share of religious division. For many years have Catholicism and Protestantism been struggling for control of it. It is time we put an end to it. No longer shall the Empire be swayed by those heretic beliefs. Only Anglicanism is to be the official religion of the Holy Roman Empire, as it is ordained by God Himself. With Anglicanism as the only official religion of the Empire, our supremacy over it is assured._
