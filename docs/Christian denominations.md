Christianity includes the Catholic, Orthodox, Hussite and Coptic denominations at the default 1444 start date. After the Protestant Reformation event, some Catholic nations and provinces will begin to adopt the Protestant and Reformed religions. Additionally, England/Great Britain get the option to convert to Anglicanism. All seven denominations consider the others to be Heretics, but not Heathens; additionally, Orthodox and Coptic countries enjoy a reduced "Tolerated Heretics" opinion penalty from and towards other Christians. Conversion from one denomination to another will cost a nation **−100** [![Yearly prestige.png](/images/thumb/f/f3/Yearly_prestige.png/28px-Yearly_prestige.png)](/Prestige "Prestige") prestige, but will give that nation **+10%** [![Missionary strength.png](/images/thumb/3/31/Missionary_strength.png/28px-Missionary_strength.png)](/Missionary_strength "Missionary strength") missionary strength for ten years. Orthodox and Coptic nations cannot convert to Protestantism, Anglicanism or Reformed, but Orthodox nations have the mission to [Restore the Pentarchy](/Restore_the_Pentarchy "Restore the Pentarchy"), which upon completion will remove the Papacy from the game, thus disabling Excommunication, Crusades, and the college of Cardinals.

Only Christians may form [personal unions](/Personal_union "Personal union").

![Catholic icon](/images/thumb/3/39/Catholic.png/40px-Catholic.png "Catholic icon")

Catholicism is the name of a Christian tradition with its roots in the old Latin rite that recognizes the Pope as the head of Christendom.  
In 1444 Catholicism is the dominant Christian Church in western and northern Europe, but it will likely be broken up by Protestantism and Reformism during the reformation.

Catholics must contend with the intricacies of the Papacy system. The Catholic hierarchy is led by the Pope and includes cardinals and bishops. In Europa Universalis IV, this is represented by the Curia—the system of reserved positions used to designate the administrative apparatus of the Roman Catholic Church, and more specifically, the Holy See.

Modifiers for being Catholic:

*   [![Tolerance of the true faith.png](/images/thumb/d/d9/Tolerance_of_the_true_faith.png/28px-Tolerance_of_the_true_faith.png)](/Tolerance_of_the_true_faith "Tolerance of the true faith") **+1** Tolerance of the True Faith

### Curia\[[edit](/index.php?title=Christian_denominations&veaction=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Curia") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Christian_denominations&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Curia")\]

_Main article: [Papacy](/Papacy "Papacy")_  

There are 49 seats in the Curia, and new [![Cardinal icon.png](/images/thumb/b/be/Cardinal_icon.png/28px-Cardinal_icon.png)](/Cardinal "Cardinal") cardinals will be appointed to vacant seats on the first day of every year. These are allocated semi-randomly among Catholic nations, favouring higher development provinces and nations with more total development.

Catholic nations accrue [![Papal influence.png](/images/thumb/5/5f/Papal_influence.png/28px-Papal_influence.png)](/Papal_influence "Papal influence") _papal influence_ which can either be invested towards a chance of being _papal controller_ or spent to gain stability, mercantilism or one of several 20-year modifiers. During the reign of a Pope, any Catholic nation (except [![Flag of the Papal State](/images/thumb/7/71/The_Papal_State.png/20px-The_Papal_State.png)](/The_Papal_State "The Papal State") [the Papal State](/The_Papal_State "The Papal State")) may convert some of their stored papal influence into installments of 10 _invested influence_, with a diminishing conversion rate each time this is done: the first 10 invested influence costs [![Papal influence.png](/images/thumb/5/5f/Papal_influence.png/28px-Papal_influence.png)](/Papal_influence "Papal influence") 5 papal influence, the next 10 invested influence costs [![Papal influence.png](/images/thumb/5/5f/Papal_influence.png/28px-Papal_influence.png)](/Papal_influence "Papal influence") 10 papal influence, then [![Papal influence.png](/images/thumb/5/5f/Papal_influence.png/28px-Papal_influence.png)](/Papal_influence "Papal influence") 15 papal influence, and so on. The Papal State does not accumulate papal influence, but automatically gains invested influence based on the number of cardinals in existence. When the current Pope dies, each Catholic nation has a chance of becoming the next papal controller equal to the ratio of their invested influence to the total invested influence of all Catholic nations (this total includes invested influence accrued _ex nihilo_ by the Papal State).

### Reform desire\[[edit](/index.php?title=Christian_denominations&veaction=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Reform desire") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Christian_denominations&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Reform desire")\]

[![Reform desire.png](/images/thumb/e/e2/Reform_desire.png/24px-Reform_desire.png)](/File:Reform_desire.png) Reform desire is a trait shared by the entire Catholic world, representing religious outrage caused by the excesses of Catholic monarchs. Reform desire increases or decreases based on monarchs' reactions to [Catholic events](/Catholic_events "Catholic events"). Once reform desire reaches a threshold (100%), the [Reformation](/Reformation "Reformation") has a chance to happen, starting the new [Protestant](#Protestant) (and later, [Reformed](#Reformed)) Christian denominations.

Regardless of the players' actions, reform desire will gradually tick up by 0.2% each year and generally increase based on AI nations' choices.

![Hussite icon](/images/thumb/2/24/Hussite.png/40px-Hussite.png "Hussite icon")

The Hussites are followers of Jan Hus, a Bohemian religious reformer who was burned at the stake for heresy in 1415. They are a diverse group of non-conformists ranging from moderates with minor theological disagreements with Catholic doctrine to radicals who see the Catholic Church as irredeemably corrupt.

Bohemia can decide early on to become Hussite after the "Return of the Hussites!" event. If chosen, it will also change the ruler to a [![Administrative power.png](/images/thumb/e/ef/Administrative_power.png/24px-Administrative_power.png)](/Administrative_power "Administrative power") **5** / [![Diplomatic power.png](/images/thumb/d/da/Diplomatic_power.png/24px-Diplomatic_power.png)](/Diplomatic_power "Diplomatic power") **4** / [![Military power.png](/images/thumb/9/98/Military_power.png/24px-Military_power.png)](/Military_power "Military power") **3** named Jirí z Podebrad.

Subsequently, when the reformation fires, another event "Hussite traditions" allows the player to convert to Protestant and if chosen also instantly converts all Hussite provinces to being Protestant and allows the player to lead the Protestant League later.

Modifiers for being Hussite:

*   [![Missionary strength vs heretics.png](/images/thumb/0/0f/Missionary_strength_vs_heretics.png/28px-Missionary_strength_vs_heretics.png)](/Missionary_strength_vs_heretics "Missionary strength vs heretics") **+2%** Missionary strength vs. heretics

![Protestant icon](/images/thumb/0/0d/Protestant.png/40px-Protestant.png "Protestant icon")

Protestantism covers a wide range of religious traditions starting with the teachings of Martin Luther during the reformation. They react against a number of the conventions that over time have developed in the Catholic church and the idea of a pope itself.  
In the game, Protestantism cover mainly countries inspired by Luther's teachings and who have formed state churches.

Protestantism is enabled in campaigns that have been started after the 31st of October 1517 ([Reformation Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reformation_Day)) _or_ after the [![Msg event.png](/images/thumb/4/4e/Msg_event.png/20px-Msg_event.png)](/Event "Event") event ‘[The Protestant Reformation](/The_Protestant_Reformation "The Protestant Reformation")’ which may happen if the [![Reform desire.png](/images/thumb/e/e2/Reform_desire.png/28px-Reform_desire.png)](/Reform_desire "Reform desire") reform desire of Catholicism has reached 100%.

The first two nations that convert to Protestantism will also get a centre of reformation in a random province. These centres of reformation convert nearby non-Protestant Christian provinces to Protestant, much like a missionary but with 5% extra conversion strength, in a maximum range of 150. A centre of reformation can only be removed by converting the province to a religion other than Protestantism, but this is very difficult as they have a **−5%** local missionary strength modifier.

10 years after the appearance of Protestantism, the Age of Discovery will end and the Age of Reformation will begin.

Church power accumulates over time and can be used to acquire up to three (3) aspects, which are permanent modifiers added to that country's particular version of Protestantism. Each aspect also has a second, temporary effect which is applied upon adoption of the aspect, making it optimal to switch aspects periodically, even possibly to aspects just removed. Similar to [idea group events](/Idea_group_events "Idea group events"), each aspect also seems to have events associated with it while active. A country can only have three aspects, after which church power can be used to trade in an existing aspect for a new one. Gaining an aspect or replacing one with another costs 100 church power.

Reformed covers a wide range of religious traditions inspired by men such as Jean Calvin or John Knox. Generally appearing later than the religions classified as Protestant the Reformed religion also rejects papal authority and want to return to the rules of the scriptures but unlike the Protestants they embrace a number of perceived more hard-line ideas such as predestination and iconoclasm and will not form state Churches.

The Reformed religion appears by [event](/Reformation_events "Reformation events"), typically 15-20 years after the Reformation begins and has the same Centers of Reformation mechanic as the Protestant religion, these centers just spread the Reformed religion instead of Protestantism.

![Orthodox icon](/images/thumb/9/96/Orthodox.png/40px-Orthodox.png "Orthodox icon")

The Orthodox Christian tradition has its root in the Greek rite and considers itself to be closer to the original Christian ideals than Catholicism. The Orthodox Churches reject the idea of the Pope and are instead divided into a number of churches presided over by Patriarchs.  
In the game much of Eastern Europe is Orthodox religion.

Every Orthodox nation has their own patriarch, who does not have to answer to the Ecumenical Patriarch in Constantinople, unlike Catholicism where all branches and sub-hierarchies exist under the singular authority of the Pope, Bishop of Rome and Patriarch of the West.

All Orthodox countries also receive:

*   [![Stability cost modifier.png](/images/thumb/e/eb/Stability_cost_modifier.png/28px-Stability_cost_modifier.png)](/Stability_cost_modifier "Stability cost modifier")**−10%** Stability cost modifier

*   **Halved relations penalty** from non-Orthodox Christians (they consider the Orthodox to be "misguided heretics")

All Orthodox provinces receive:

*   [![Local missionary strength.png](/images/thumb/0/08/Local_missionary_strength.png/28px-Local_missionary_strength.png)](/Local_missionary_strength "Local missionary strength")**−1%** Local missionary strength[\[1\]](#cite_note-harder-1)

_NB: If playing a converted Crusader Kings 2 save in which the schism has been mended, Catholicism will become a heresy of Orthodoxy._

### Patriarch authority\[[edit](/index.php?title=Christian_denominations&veaction=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Patriarch authority") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Christian_denominations&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Patriarch authority")\]

The Orthodox religion has the unique feature of [![Patriarch authority.png](/images/thumb/a/af/Patriarch_authority.png/28px-Patriarch_authority.png)](/Patriarch_authority "Patriarch authority") patriarch authority. Events will periodically pop up enabling you to increase or decrease the authority and prestige of your autocephalous patriarchate. Patriarch authority is not shared between all Orthodox nations in the way that [reform desire](/Reform_desire "Reform desire") is shared among all Catholics; each Orthodox nation has its own patriarch authority (thus, for example, Muscovy's decisions will not affect Byzantium's patriarch authority). This reflects the autocephaly of the Orthodox church.

Each point of authority will increase missionary strength by **0.02%** for the entire country, while reducing local unrest by **−0.03** and increasing the manpower pool by **0.33%** in Orthodox provinces, ultimately reaching the numbers below at 100%.

Orthodox countries may use the ‘Consecrate Metropolitan’ mechanic in [states](/State "State") that meet the following criteria:

*   At least 30 development in provinces in the state owned and cored by this country
*   All provinces in the state must be Orthodox
*   All provinces in the state must be either of an accepted culture or part of that country's culture group.
*   No province in the state may be a territorial core

Consecrating a metropolitan gives a one-time boost of **5%** patriarch authority, and has the following permanent effects on the state:

Turning a state which has been consecrated into a territory will revoke its consecration and remove these effects.

If the country has consecrated a metropolitan then [metropolitan events](/Metropolitan_events "Metropolitan events") may trigger.

![Coptic icon](/images/thumb/7/74/Coptic.png/40px-Coptic.png "Coptic icon")

Coptic Christianity is a branch of Christendom that follow the Alexandrine rite and who answer to the Patriarch in Alexandria.  
With the fall of Egypt to the Muslims hundreds of years ago the Patriarch is controlled by a Non-Christian state with the Coptic religion surviving as the majority faith only in Ethiopia and Nubia.

The Coptic Church (Miaphysitism) is an ancient Christian denomination. The head of the church is the Patriarch of Alexandria, also known as the Coptic Pope. This denomination was dominant among the native Egyptians, Abyssinians, Armenians, and Assyrians (technically only Egyptians and Abyssinians are part of the Coptic Church, but Armenians and Assyrians are similar enough that the game represents them as the same religion). The Islamic conquest of the Middle East led to the Copts becoming subjugated and gradually converting over the subsequent centuries until they became a minority.

All Coptic countries receive:

*   [![Tolerance of the true faith.png](/images/thumb/d/d9/Tolerance_of_the_true_faith.png/28px-Tolerance_of_the_true_faith.png)](/Tolerance_of_the_true_faith "Tolerance of the true faith")**+1** Tolerance of the True Faith

[](/File:Coptic_blessings.jpg "Enlarge")

A list of patriarchal blessings.

Coptic countries get a unique Holy Sites system. They will have access to a screen showing their Holy Sites. There are 5 in total. In the coptic faith screen is detailed who is currently controlling which site and the faith followed by the province. It is the Copts' holy mission to see these restored to Coptic control.

The following provinces are Holy Sites:

*   Aksum (1227) – controlled by [![Flag of Ethiopia](/images/thumb/0/06/Ethiopia.png/20px-Ethiopia.png)](/Ethiopia "Ethiopia") [Ethiopia](/Ethiopia "Ethiopia")
*   Qasr Ibrim (1234) – controlled by [![Flag of Makuria](/images/thumb/8/87/Makuria.png/20px-Makuria.png)](/Makuria "Makuria") [Makuria](/Makuria "Makuria")

[![](/images/5/54/Coptic_Holy_Sites.png)](/File:Coptic_Holy_Sites.png)

The position of the Holy Sites for Coptic religion.

If a Holy Site is held by any Coptic nation and the province itself is Coptic then all Coptic nations will be granted a blessing from the Patriarch. Nations are able to pick from the 5 available blessings, however losing ownership of a Holy Site to a nation of another faith will remove the blessing until it is returned to Coptic hands. If a blessing has been picked, it can not be exchanged for a different one.

In 1444 the only Holy site that is Coptic and in the control of the Copts is Aksum, in the far north of [![Flag of Ethiopia](/images/thumb/0/06/Ethiopia.png/20px-Ethiopia.png)](/Ethiopia "Ethiopia") [Ethiopia](/Ethiopia "Ethiopia"). This allows all existing Coptic nations to pick one blessing of their choice from the list below. Qasr Ibrim, is also under Coptic control at 1444; unlike Aksum, though, its population is not Coptic itself, although [![Flag of Makuria](/images/thumb/8/87/Makuria.png/20px-Makuria.png)](/Makuria "Makuria") [Makuria](/Makuria "Makuria") gets an event that gives a province modifier to Qasr Ibrim that makes it easier to convert the province to Coptic Orthodoxy.

Unlike other religious mechanics, the Coptic Holy Sites collectively make all followers of that religion stronger. It makes no difference in the available Blessings if the player's nation or another Coptic nation holds the Holy Sites. Should the Copts fight back from their perilous position in 1444 and secure their Holy Sites, they will be that much stronger.

Anglicanism is a form of christianity in which the head of state is also the Supreme Governor of the Church. Theologically and institutionally, Anglicanism retains many elements of Catholicism while also being influenced by Reformed Puritans and continental Protestants.

The Anglican faith is a fusion of Catholic and Protestant theology forged in the religious disputes in England of the 15th and 16th centuries, particularly the two Acts of Supremacy under Henry VIII and Elizabeth I. It can appear somewhere in the Britain region, at least 15 years after Protestantism appears but before 1600. Depending on the choice of the country that gets the event, it may or may not get a Center of Reformation.

_As the Protestant Reformation radically shifts the religious landscape of Europe, $COUNTRY$ must take a firm stance on its faith. This has of course provoked much discussion in court, with some favoring the Protestant cause and others defending the traditional religion.  
  
\[Root.Monarch.GetTitle\] \[Root.Monarch.GetName\], however, has a novel idea for the creation of a different sort of Church. A Church with the \[Root.Monarch.GetTitle\] as its Supreme Governor, a happy union of Church and state. Neither Protestant, Catholic, nor Reformed, it would take a flexible approach to doctrine as fits the circumstance.  
  
Such a Church would have its advantages. No longer subject to any higher ecclesiastical authority, the \[Root.Monarch.GetTitle\] could marry and divorce at will, determine the nation’s theological direction, and have the assurance that they are appointed to rule directly by God._
