_This page deals with the **the individual naval unit types**. For information on the recruitment and maintenance of navies see [navy](/Navy "Navy"). For naval combat mechanics see [naval warfare](/Naval_warfare "Naval warfare")._  

There are four basic classes of **naval units** available ([![Heavy ship.png](/images/thumb/5/50/Heavy_ship.png/28px-Heavy_ship.png)](/Heavy_ship "Heavy ship")_heavy ships_, [![Light ship.png](/images/thumb/c/cd/Light_ship.png/28px-Light_ship.png)](/Light_ship "Light ship")_light ships_, [![Galley.png](/images/thumb/3/3b/Galley.png/28px-Galley.png)](/Galley "Galley")_galleys_ and [![Transport.png](/images/thumb/6/62/Transport.png/28px-Transport.png)](/Transport "Transport")_transports_) with each class specialising in a particular role.

Each ship class has several distinct properties which affect combat performance:

[![Hull.png](/images/thumb/8/8c/Hull.png/28px-Hull.png)](/Ship_hull "Ship hull")**Hull strength**

Represents the durability of the ship.

[![Sailors.png](/images/thumb/8/8f/Sailors.png/28px-Sailors.png)](/Sailors "Sailors")**Sailors**

The number of sailors required to crew the ship.

[![Icon ship cannons.png](/images/thumb/1/13/Icon_ship_cannons.png/28px-Icon_ship_cannons.png)](/Cannons "Cannons")**Cannons**

Determines the damage done in combat.

[![Icon ship speed.png](/images/thumb/5/54/Icon_ship_speed.png/28px-Icon_ship_speed.png)](/Ship_speed "Ship speed")**Speed**

Refers to the strategic movement speed of the unit, as on how fast ships travels on the map. This is distinct from the tactical movement speed, which determines your ships base blockading trade power.

[![Engagement width.png](/images/thumb/b/b7/Engagement_width.png/28px-Engagement_width.png)](/Engagement_width "Engagement width")**Engagement width**

Determines how many _spaces_ a ship occupies in the [engagement width](/Engagement_width "Engagement width") of a naval battle.

Additionally, _light ships_ have a unique property:

[![Trade power.png](/images/thumb/1/10/Trade_power.png/28px-Trade_power.png)](/Trade_power "Trade power")**Trade power**

Represents the potential trade power value of this ship if ordered to [protect trade](/Protect_trade "Protect trade") in a particular trade node.

The speed values listed for naval units in-game refer to their strategic movement speed, it determines how fast a ship can travel between sea zones on the map. It is not to be confused with tactical speed, which determines the base ship blockade power. Note that the tactical speed is no longer shown in game.

Fleets will always travel at the strategic speed of their slowest ship. Hence, you could use light ships to lead your fleet and catch the enemy while waiting for your main fleet to engage, or be sure to keep galleys separate from your main fleet if you want the main fleet not to be held back.

Note that the blockade impact of a ship (the amount of trade power it steals when blockading) is also equal to its tactical speed value. Therefore light ships are best at blockading (10 per ship) and galleys next best (8 per ship).

### Leader-based modifiers\[[edit](/index.php?title=Naval_units&veaction=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Leader-based modifiers") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Naval_units&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Leader-based modifiers")\]

#### Leader traits\[[edit](/index.php?title=Naval_units&veaction=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Leader traits") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Naval_units&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Leader traits")\]

[![Rights of Man.png](/images/thumb/5/50/Rights_of_Man.png/28px-Rights_of_Man.png)](/Rights_of_Man "Rights of Man")

Available only with the [Rights of Man](/Rights_of_Man "Rights of Man") DLC enabled.

The _“[Accomplished Sailor](/Accomplished_Sailor "Accomplished Sailor")”_ trait for naval leaders gives [![Movement speed.png](/images/thumb/8/8a/Movement_speed.png/28px-Movement_speed.png)](/Movement_speed "Movement speed") **+10%** movement speed to the fleet which the leader commands.

### Travel time\[[edit](/index.php?title=Naval_units&veaction=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Travel time") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Naval_units&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Travel time")\]

The travel time between two sea zones is determined by:

![{\displaystyle {\text{travel time}}={\frac {\text{distance}}{{\text{strategic speed}}\cdot (100\%+{\text{leader-based modifiers}})}}}](https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/png/c99203ff0b7156f27ae92e4cfb2d6771ef6e5458)

with the final value rounded up to the nearest integer. The distance between two sea zones can be found by selecting a naval unit and reading the tooltip that appears when the mouse is hovered over another sea zone or port. Note that the formula above may slightly vary between certain sea zones.

Durability\[[edit](/index.php?title=Naval_units&veaction=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Durability") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Naval_units&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Durability")\]

![Ship durability icon](/images/thumb/5/58/Ship_durability.png/40px-Ship_durability.png "Ship durability icon")

Ship Durability measures how much of a beating your Navy can take in battle before sinking below the sea. The higher it is, the better.

The durability of a ship determines how much damage a ship takes from incoming fire. For example, a **10%** durability modifier would mean that a ship would lose 9 sailors instead of 10 sailors during battle (does not affect damage from [attrition](/Attrition "Attrition")). A ship's base durability depends on its hull strength. Hence, see hull strength as equivalent to damage resistance (the damage suffered being directly proportional to the number of cannon fire it receives).

Durability is one of the most underrated yet important factors in naval warfare. Both formulas to calculate hull damage (and hence the strength of your ships) and morale losses use durability as the denominator. This means that it one can drastically reduce the overall damage and moral losses of ones navy by pursuing high durability. The simplest methods would be to research the 4th Quality idea and implementing the "Hold the Weather Gauge" policy from Offensive and Maritime.

These modifiers increase the durability of any type of ship:

![Heavy ship icon](/images/5/50/Heavy_ship.png "Heavy ship icon")

With the exception of closed waters like the Mediterranean the man 'o war or the ship of the line is the prime combat vessel.

Ship-for-ship, heavy ships are by far the most powerful in combat. However, they are also the most expensive, especially in terms of maintenance. This makes them the combat ship of choice for rich nations that dream of naval supremacy. They also take up 3 spaces in the engagement width instead of the regular 1. Heavy ships can be used for [exploration](/Exploration "Exploration").

### Combat ability\[[edit](/index.php?title=Naval_units&veaction=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Combat ability") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Naval_units&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Combat ability")\]

The design of this late medieval ship combined the features of Germanic longships and Arabic merchantmen. It was less maneuverable than the caravel, but because of its larger size, it could carry provisions for long voyages, cargo for trade, and guns for self-defense._

Light ships\[[edit](/index.php?title=Naval_units&veaction=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Light ships") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Naval_units&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Light ships")\]

![Light ship icon](/images/c/cd/Light_ship.png "Light ship icon")

Small, fast and maneuverable, the light ship excels in the role of commerce defense. Wherever your light ships go, merchants who fly your flag will feel safe.

Light ships can increase a country's [trade power](/Trade_power "Trade power") in a certain trade node and thereby the trade profits by [protecting trade](/Protect_trade "Protect trade"), and are also ideal for [exploration](/Exploration "Exploration") due to their speed (as long as they are not slowed down by other ship types in the same fleet). This makes them a prime choice in times of peace. However, they perform poorly in battle: they cannot stand up to heavy ships or galleys in combat. Still, they are much better in this role than transports, and they excel in blockading.

### Combat ability\[[edit](/index.php?title=Naval_units&veaction=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Combat ability") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Naval_units&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Combat ability")\]

![Galley icon](/images/3/3b/Galley.png "Galley icon")

The shallow draft of the galley gives it poor sea keeping on the high seas, but in enclosed waters the oar powered galley is the prime warship.

These cheap ships are ideal for fighting in inland seas (e.g. Mediterranean, Baltic, Sea of Japan, Chinese coast), where they have a +100% combat ability bonus while also allowing 3 times as many ships to fight at once compared to heavy ships, making for a stronger fleet at a significantly lower price. On non-inland sea they retain a +50% combat ability bonus when fighting on coasts. However, they are far quicker to sink due to the smaller hull size and lack of defensive bonuses, will take up much more naval [force limit](/Force_limit "Force limit"), and move across the map only slowly. In deep waters, they will only slightly outperform light ships.

_With roots back to the ancient ships of the antiquity, the galley remained the prime choice for Mediterranean naval warfare until the 16th century. The galley was primarily propelled by oars, usually about 25 pairs manned by up to three men each. This meant that they were less dependent on wind gauge compared to sailing ships, and their maneuverability made them a feared adversary. Eventually, the galley went out of regular use with the introduction of more advanced oceangoing men-of-war, but remained useful in shallow waters until the 18th century._

_The galleass was an adaptation of the large merchant galley to counter the increasing use of man-of-war. Larger than the galley, the galleass had about 32 oar pairs, each oar manned by up to five men. As an answer to the men-of-war's armament and higher sides, the galleass had forecastles and aftcastles and gundecks above the rowers. This extra weight meant that they also had to rely more on sails, and were slower and less maneuverable compared to galleys. Like the galley, the galleass went out of regular use with the introduction of more advanced oceangoing men-of-war, but remained useful in shallow waters until the 18th century._

![Transport icon](/images/6/62/Transport.png "Transport icon")

Everyone knows that soldiers simply cannot magically turn into boats, the transport ship is a vessel specially built to move armies from A to B on the High Seas.

Each transport can carry only one regiment (of any type), regardless of the regiment being at full strength or not. Though reasonably durable compared to light ships and galleys, they lack the firepower of combat ships, and should generally seek to avoid combat situations. An exception to this is a late-game [western](/Western "Western") transport fleet fighting against much less advanced foes, where technology differences give transport ships a more evenly-matched fight against even the enemy's heavy ships.

Flagships are unique ships that give special bonuses to all ships in fleet with them. A nation may only have one flagship of their own (not counting captured flagship which lose their bonuses but keep their name and icon). A flagship can be any combat ship type (non-transport). When building the flagship, the nation chooses up to three special abilities for the flagship. Each special ability increases the maintenance cost of the ship. Nations must have 1500 sailors worth of active ships before their navy is large enough to be allowed to build a flagship.

Sinking another nation's flagship in combat is worth [![Yearly prestige.png](/images/thumb/f/f3/Yearly_prestige.png/28px-Yearly_prestige.png)](/Prestige "Prestige")**+5** prestige; capturing it instead is worth [![Yearly prestige.png](/images/thumb/f/f3/Yearly_prestige.png/28px-Yearly_prestige.png)](/Prestige "Prestige")**+10** prestige.

Notes:

1.  [↑](#cite_ref-1 "Jump up") This is probably an ironic joke by the Swedish developers: the Swedish ship _Vasa_ sank on her maiden voyage in 1628 due to being top heavy with cannons.
2.  ↑ [Jump up to: 2.0](#cite_ref-trade_power_2-0) [2.1](#cite_ref-trade_power_2-1) For all ship types, not only light ships.
3.  [↑](#cite_ref-3 "Jump up") Cannons count twice for hunting pirates.
4.  [↑](#cite_ref-4 "Jump up") This effectively removes the [landing penalty](/Land_warfare#Crossing_penalties "Land warfare").

Please help with verifying or updating this section. It was last verified for [version](/Europa_Universalis_4_Wiki:Versioning "Europa Universalis 4 Wiki:Versioning") 1.31.

Ignoring modifiers, the most import factor determining the outcome of a battle is the relative difference between hull strength (equivalent to damage resistance) and the number of cannons firing on it. The damage suffered is directly proportional to the number of cannon fire it receives.

Therefore, in the table below an Early Carrack applies 2:1 damage (40 cannons vs 20 hull strength) to another Early Carrack than say the 1.5:1 damage (12 cannons vs 8 hull strength) of a Galley to Galley interaction. Note that one heavy ship takes up three engagement width relative to other ships so cannot be compared directly to the other types (for example, it takes approximately 6 galleys to reach parity when fighting a heavy ship).

Note that sailors is the proxy for "ship strength" in the battle view that shows the percentage strength – the number of sailors left alive – of each ship engaged in battle.

The columns below from left to right are hull strength, cannons, strategic map speed, and sailors (sailors being the proxy for ship strength). The sequence of the _rows_ is the order of engagement priority in an ongoing naval battle to try and populate the fleet's full engagement width until the limit is reached, the order being heavy ships, galleys, light ships, transports.

_The most powerful of the four types, with more Hull Strength, Cannons and Sailors but requiring 3 engagement width vs one for the other three types. One of only two types, the other being galleys, built for battle. Like transports it has the weakest blockading power of only 5 per ship._

_The second most powerful of the four types. One of only two types, the other being heavy ships, built for battle. Most powerfully the total damage it deals the enemy is doubled (**+100%** damage bonus) in inland seas, and half more (**+50%** damage bonus) on the coast. Although galleys have a low cost to high cannon ratio, as well as the highest cannons:hull strength ratio (1.5:1), what makes fleets of them poorer choices relative to heavies is (i) the large relative sailor pool they require to operate monthly and (2) naval force limits - whereby a heavy ship may be better use of a slot for attack and a light ship more useful for trade power/blocakding. Galleys have the second best blockading power of 8 per ship. Galleys are the slowest ships in-game and worsen over time; at the start they are 33% slower than heavy ships and by late game they are 44% slower - nearly half. Hence if even one galley is mixed with the main fleet, the entire fleet will be slowed down._

_The third most powerful of the four types. Unlike heavy ships and galleys this is_ not _meant for battle, however, it is able to be a light "skirmisher" fleet. Notably it is the_ only _ship that can be used to enhance trade power in a node (each barque adds **+2** trade power to a trade node). As the fastest ship (two thirds faster than heavy ships) it can be used during warfare to catch-up runaway enemies and delay them while the main fleet catches up to engage in the battle. Light ships have the best blockading power of 10 per ship - double that of heavy ships or cogs._

_The transport is the weakest ship type of the four and not meant for warfare at all. Each transport ship can carry one land unit across water tiles. Remarkably it can take relatively more damage to its hull than either galleys or light ships but it has almost no cannons to attack. Like heavy ships it has the weakest blockading power of only 5 per ship._

![Strategy](/images/thumb/a/a2/Years_of_separatism.png/36px-Years_of_separatism.png "Strategy") _The below is **one of many** player suggested strategies for **Naval units**. Bear in mind, due to the dynamic nature of the game, it may unfold differently for other players._

Please refer to [naval warfare](/Naval_warfare "Naval warfare") for full details. However, the combination of naval units, admiral skill and the impact of engagement width can be summarised as follows. Generally speaking in a naval battle one could assume that:

*   The fleet with the larger engagement width (assuming they fill all of it with ships) should win (remember both fleets suffer a **−20%** reduction in width when near the coast).
*   Higher engagement width means one can send more high cannon ships into battle to apply maximum damage to the hulls of the opposing ships.
*   All ships up to the full engagement width will fire at the opposing ships.
*   The key is to have maximum cannons firing at minimum hull strength, so for example a large line width of cannon-laden heavies firing at a narrow line comprising a few transports.
*   The quickest way to ensure the highest engagement width is to send a high manoeuvre admiral into the battle, receiving **+10%** width for each pip (up to 6) of manoeuvre (note that if you send multiple admirals the one with the overall highest pips will lead the fight, so make sure to only send the high manoeuvre one).
*   Choosing between a high fire and shock pip admiral or one with high manoeuvre to go into battle it is typically better to go for manoeuvre to get the higher engagement width.
*   Heavies are best to send into battle to fill the engagement width (remember they take three slots each), unless fighting in an _inland sea_ where it's best to fill the engagement width with galleys that receive a **+100%** to final damage done. If not an inland sea, or the open sea, the _near coast_ final damage bonus for galleys (**+50%**) helps, but is typically not enough to offset the power of heavies.
*   It is best not to use light ships and transports in battle. However, if one's engagement width is fuller than the enemy's then any additional cannons from light ships and transports will materially shift the fleet damage done in one's favour.
*   Towards the tail end of a large existing battle when there may not remain sufficient heavies and galleys to fill the engagement width any more, feeding fresh high-morale light ships and transports from a tile next door into the battle each few days can significantly shift the battle to a quick victory.
