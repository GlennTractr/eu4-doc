Free features\[[edit](/index.php?title=Wealth_of_Nations&veaction=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Free features") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Wealth_of_Nations&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Free features")\]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   [Rivals](/Rival "Rival")
    *   [Countries](/Countries "Countries") now pick rivals from a list of nearby nations that aren't too strong or too weak compared to that country. Larger nations can pick rivals further away. Picking a rival gives all the previous benefits of having a rival and also unlocks the [Power Projection system](/Power_Projection "Power Projection").
    *   You gain Power Projection by having longtime rivals and acting aggressively against those rivals by for example [declaring war](/War "War") on them, taking [provinces](/Provinces "Provinces") from them, [subsidizing](/Subsidies "Subsidies") their enemies and sending [privateers](/Privateers "Privateers") against them. You lose Power Projection from having too few rivals picked and losing provinces to your rivals.
    *   Power Projection gives bonuses to [Trade Power](/Trade_Power "Trade Power"), [Fort Defense](/Fort_defence "Fort defence"), [Land Morale](/Land_morale "Land morale"), [Naval Morale](/Naval_morale "Naval morale"), [Legitimacy](/Legitimacy "Legitimacy") and [Republican Tradition](/Republican_Tradition "Republican Tradition"). Additionally, at 25 Power Projection a nation gets +1 [Leader without Upkeep](/Leader(s)_without_upkeep "Leader(s) without upkeep") and at 50 Power Projection it gets +1 to monthly [Administrative, Diplomatic and Military Power](/Monarch_power "Monarch power").
*   [Policies](/Policies "Policies")
    *   New Policy Interface under [Missions](/Missions "Missions") and [Decisions](/Decisions "Decisions") Tab
    *   Completing two full [Idea Groups](/Idea_groups "Idea groups") unlocks several Policies
    *   Activating a policy gives bonuses but costs 1 monarch point per month of a specific type.
    *   Several old decisions now converted to policies
*   New [Trade Conflict CB](/Casus_Belli "Casus Belli") given by Justify Trade Conflict
*   Ticking [warscore](/Warscore "Warscore") from [blockades](/Blockade "Blockade")
*   New [Colonial Region](/Colonial_regions "Colonial regions") Australia
*   Now possible to easily detach obsolete ships with one button
*   Improved Macro-builder Interface
*   Now possible to Build [cores](/Cores "Cores"), Change [Culture](/Culture "Culture") and do [Harsh Treatment](/Harsh_treatment "Harsh treatment") from the Macro-builder Interface
*   Now possible to change role of trader without travel time
*   Added New [ships](/Ships "Ships"), Great Frigate, War Galley, Galiot, Brig and Trabakul
*   Added three [religions](/Religions "Religions"), Coptic (Christianity), Ibadi (Islam), and Sikh (Sikhism). Coptic (Ethiopia) and Ibadi (Oman) are present from the 1444 start, Sikh will appear later.
*   Modifiers such as [Estuary](/Estuary "Estuary") now shown on map in Trade Mapmode.
*   Now possible to form the nations [![Flag of Egypt](/images/thumb/3/37/Egypt.png/20px-Egypt.png)](/Egypt "Egypt") [Egypt](/Egypt "Egypt"), [![Flag of Bukhara](/images/thumb/7/71/Bukhara.png/20px-Bukhara.png)](/Bukhara "Bukhara") [Bukhara](/Bukhara "Bukhara") and [![Flag of Kurland](/images/thumb/a/ab/Kurland.png/20px-Kurland.png)](/Kurland "Kurland") [Kurland](/Kurland "Kurland").
*   [Administrative efficiency](/Administrative_efficiency "Administrative efficiency") is a new country wide bonus that is unlocked at administrative technology level 23 and increases at 26 and 29, up to a total of 75%. Administrative Efficiency directly reduces the impact of province [base tax](/Base_tax "Base tax") on [overextension](/Overextension "Overextension") and warscore cost, allowing for much larger territories to be conquered at once.
*   The scaling of core time from country size has been removed - all nations now core provinces at the same speed regardless of size (but it is still affected by factors such as culture, religion, having a [claim](/Claim "Claim") and so on).
*   New Launcher with Steamworks support, subscribe to the [mods](/Mods "Mods") in steam and the launcher will update accordingly.
*   Buildable [Canals](/Canals "Canals"): Now possible to build the Kiel Canal, the Suez Canal and the Panama Canal. (Originally contained in the DLC)
