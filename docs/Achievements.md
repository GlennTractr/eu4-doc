_For tips and tricks on how to complete an achievement, see **[the achievements category](/Category:Achievements "Category:Achievements")**._  

EU4 has 354 different **achievements**, all using the Steam achievements mechanics. Achievements have no in-game effects; the achievement just pops up in-game and then added to the player's Steam profile. It is possible to see the achievements sorted by the percentage of users that managed to complete each achievement by going to the game's [global achievements at Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/stats/236850/achievements/) (for more precise numbers one can use the [Steam web API](https://api.steampowered.com/ISteamUserStats/GetGlobalAchievementPercentagesForApp/v0002/?gameid=236850)).

The difficulty of each achievement varies; some achievements are very easy (e.g. signing a royal marriage with another country), while some are extremely difficult (e.g. taking all of Asia's grassland as Kale before the age of absolutism). The below list groups the various achievements by a difficulty level as assessed by the wiki editors (uncategorized - UC - achievements haven't been assessed yet).

To gain achievements one needs to play in ironman and also obey the following requirements(ironman itself is still possible even when not fulfilling these requirements):

*   The game files must have the correct checksum for the [game version](/Patches "Patches"). So no gameplay altering mod may be active and the game files must not be corrupted or modified in a different way. Most graphical, interface or music mods don't alter the checksum and thus are allowed.
*   The following [options](/Options "Options") are required:
    *   _Difficulty_ must be set to _“Normal”_ or higher.
    *   _[Lucky](/Luck "Luck") nations_ must be set to _“Historical”_.
    *   _Limited country forming_ must be set to _“Yes”_.
    *   _Province Tax and Manpower_ must be set to _“Normal values”_.
    *   _Nations_ must be set to _“Normal setup”_ or _“Historical setup”_.
*   All but 4 achievements require that the game was started at 11 November 1444(exceptions are noted in the [list](/Achievements#List_of_achievements "Achievements")).
*   Most achievements don't allow any [custom nations](/Custom_nation "Custom nation") on the map(exceptions are noted in the [list](/Achievements#List_of_achievements "Achievements")).
*   Some achievements don't allow the player to play as a released vassal and this also prohibits playing as a released colonial nation and switching to a different country in an event(forming countries via event is allowed). These are noted in the [list](/Achievements#List_of_achievements "Achievements").
*   Most achievements have _Starting conditions_ which have to be fulfilled when starting the campaign before any player input. These are noted in the _Starting conditions_ column of the [list](/Achievements#List_of_achievements "Achievements").

Achievements can be earned while playing older versions of the game (1.6 and above) as long as the given achievement was present in that version. E.g., _Azur semé de lis or_ can be earned in 1.11, but _Big Blue Blob_ cannot, since it was only added in 1.12.

Achievement

This column shows the icon, name (optional with a link to a guide) and the description of the achievement.

Starting conditions

This column contains the conditions which have to be fulfilled at the start of the campaign.

Completion requirements

This column lists the conditions which will award the achievement if they are fulfilled in a campaign which already fulfilled the “starting conditions” at the start of the campaign. Note that the in-game logic for showing an achievement in the list sometimes erroneously contains an extra "Playing as <tag>" and as such some achievements which are still possible may be hidden from the player upon forming another nation (eg. "Eat your greens", "Basque in Glory", "An Unlikely Candidate" etc.). Fulfilling the requirements will un-hide the achievement.

Notes

This column lists helpful short tips/strategies.

Easy to do as [![Flag of Aragon](/images/thumb/6/61/Aragon.png/20px-Aragon.png)](/Aragon "Aragon") [Aragon](/Aragon "Aragon") within 1-2 years.

Send a merchant to collect trade in Valencia. Then grant the Burghers the 'Exclusive Trade Rights' privilege, that grants 3 immediate mercantilism. Without unpausing, recall your merchant from Valencia. Unpause, and the privilege will be revoked due to there not being a trade node where you own 3 centers of trade and are collecting. The player can then send the merchant to Valencia again, give the privilege and recall the merchant. Repeat this process until 100% mercantilism is reached. Alternatively, this process can be done with any nation that has 3 centers of trade in any trade node and at least one province in a node that the nation does not own 3 centers of trade.

Some nations this method can be applied to at the 1444 start date include [![Flag of Castile](/images/thumb/e/ee/Castile.png/20px-Castile.png)](/Castile "Castile") [Castile](/Castile "Castile"), [![Flag of England](/images/thumb/2/21/England.png/20px-England.png)](/England "England") [England](/England "England"), [![Flag of Tunis](/images/thumb/7/79/Tunis.png/20px-Tunis.png)](/Tunis "Tunis") [Tunis](/Tunis "Tunis"), [![Flag of Poland](/images/thumb/9/99/Poland.png/20px-Poland.png)](/Poland "Poland") [Poland](/Poland "Poland"), [![Flag of Ming](/images/thumb/a/a5/Ming.png/20px-Ming.png)](/Ming "Ming") [Ming](/Ming "Ming") and [![Flag of Vijayanagar](/images/thumb/3/31/Vijayanagar.png/20px-Vijayanagar.png)](/Vijayanagar "Vijayanagar") [Vijayanagar](/Vijayanagar "Vijayanagar").

This can be done easily by starting as Bohemia and then releasing Moravia as a vassal and selecting the option to play as the released vassal.

Several of the privileges do not affect the size of the Crown Land which makes it easy to stay above 50%.

This achievement can be combined with the Great Moravia achievement.

It is possible to create a custom nation with 2000 development with only 50 points, although it is very tedious to do so. First, select a capital within Central Asia, be a duchy. Get the worst possible ruler, heir, and consort, and make them as young as possible. Then, you should pick the ideas that cost _negative points_, from most negative points to least (they are found under administrative ideas). You should be left with three idea slots, which you should fill with administrative ideas that cost no points. Finally, take all provinces with the [lowest terrain multiplier](/Nation_designer#Cost "Nation designer") until you have 2000 development. Avoid taking provinces with gold or trade bonuses, since they will cost more.

Regardless of the nation selected, declare a war in which land may be taken from Tunis. Take the Tunisia area in the war. Then go bankrupt repeatedly until you have 100 devastation (going bankrupt adds 10 devastation to all provinces). The first bankruptcy can be declared manually, but this button can't be used while being bankrupt. So the subsequent bankruptcies must be achieved by taking the maximum amount of loans and spending all the money while running a deficit. A high deficit can be achieved by using the loans to hire and upgrade advisors. This is far faster than trying to raise devastation using other methods such as occupying the land while at war and using scorch earth.

[![Yes](/images/thumb/d/da/Ledger_yes.png/28px-Ledger_yes.png)](/File:Ledger_yes.png "Yes") Won a war with over 1 million casualties on both sides.

*   Both sides each need to have at least 1 million casualties (attrition _does_ count) in the war details screen when the war leader is peaced out. Allies and enemies that are peaced out before the war leader do not contribute their casualties.
*   League Wars (requires [![Art of War.png](/images/thumb/0/0f/Art_of_War.png/28px-Art_of_War.png)](/Art_of_War "Art of War") Art of War) can be a good time to get this achievement if you are the war leader. Protect your allies and don't separate peace countries. Alternatively, you can trigger a big war in the late 1700s after you get strong. Regardless, be prepared to buy down war exhaustion as the war will almost certainly last way longer than it should.

Suggested strategy: expand rapidly as you normally would with the Ottomans until you have ~1200 development. Then, plan to release-and-play as Saruhan, taking most of Otto's lands. To do this, you will need to release Saruhan as vassal, wait 10 years, start to annex (to designate cores), feed it land, finalize annexation, and then release-and-play. You can cheese the release-and-play by feeding past the point of loyalty and then applying all available [annexation cost](/Vassal#Cost "Vassal") reductions (Acquire Subjects mission, Influence idea, Amirs privilege, as well as any possible Policies). Make sure you wait until the last day of the month to do this, or else annexation progress will drop and you will be unable to proceed. As long as your annexation progress is above 100 on the month tick, it won't matter if liberty desire is over 50%.

Once you have reannexed, you will be able to release-and-play. Ideally you will then own almost all Ottoman lands, making independence relatively easy to pursue. From there, you need to obtain 9 loyal vassals (NOT marches, NOT client states) with 100+ development. Rather than directly subjugating enemies to meet the vassal count, it is suggested that the player conquer and then [release vassals](/Vassal#Releasing_a_nation "Vassal"); this avoids the forced vassalization malus. To help reduce liberty desire and thus total development needed, choose the relevant policies, and be sure to get the [Splendor abilities in the Age of Revolutions](/Ages#Abilities_4 "Ages") (Anti-Revolutionary Zeal + Loyal Subjects). Upon release, you will no longer have the Ottoman government form, and should choose [Iqta](/Monarchy#Iqta "Monarchy"). Then on your goverment tab choose Lenient Taxation, which provides another Liberty Desire reduction.

Note that during the feeding of Saruhan and following your transition to playing as them, the Ottomans will likely be severely weakened and thus open to attack. Keep this in mind, perhaps securing treaties in advance or locking in allies (though too many allies for Otto will make subsequent independence harder). Ideally you will be able to secure independence support from a rival.

Exploiting production development in coastal provinces generates sailors even if the maximum has already been reached, but this reduces the maximum, so it is only useful if 100k can actually be reached in this way.

Afterwards, expand in power so that you can combat your most powerful neighbours - Ottomans, Spain, France, etc. Make sure to give Bremen land, either in the direction of the Ottomans or in the direction of Spain. You will have to fight your way through at least one, feeding Bremen provinces to "snake" their land down to Werder (this is because vassals need adjacent land or sea tiles to be given provinces and do not care about coring distance/colonial range).

You need to directly own and core the target provinces, and not through your colonial nation. There are several ways to achieve this:

Move your capital city to North America before a colonial nation forms.

Get a colonial nation in one of the colonial regions adjacent to Mexico and grant them a chain of colonized or conquered provinces in Mexico up to the achievement provinces with the help of the grant province subject interaction(or by transferring occupations in a war if they are on the same continent as the capital of the CN). The achievement provinces can be cored as soon as the colonial nation has cored a province next to them.

Vassalize a native, take land from some other native including the needed ones and a chain of provinces leading to the coast. Core one coastal province to be able to start coring the 4 achievement provinces. To avoid forming a colonial nation, the cored coastal province then has to be given to the vassal.

Use the [![Ab no distance for core.png](/images/thumb/0/08/Ab_no_distance_for_core.png/24px-Ab_no_distance_for_core.png)](/File:Ab_no_distance_for_core.png) Unrestricted Conquest age ability from the [![Age of Revolutions.png](/images/thumb/5/59/Age_of_Revolutions.png/24px-Age_of_Revolutions.png)](/Age_of_Revolutions "Age of Revolutions") Age of Revolutions.

As England release Mann at the very start of the game. After 10 years you can annex them again. As the annexation progresses grant them your provinces bit by bit before the process hits 100%. You can even move your capital to continental Europe and give London to Mann. Be careful about France as they will likely attack you once you are weakened. After annexation is finished spend all your monarch points to boost provinces that Mann considers as a core. Now release Mann again and chose to play as a released vassal. Do _not_ form England again or any other country because it will prevent getting the achievement. Alternatively, sabotage England as much as possible, such as releasing all releasable nations, leaving Mann for last. Release and play as them, then ally all other released nations, plus a major like Castile. Take London, Sussex, and Kent in your first war and you should be off to a great start.

it is allowed to have provinces on islands, but these don't count towards the 20. Islands in the context of this achievement means any province which does not have a land connection to mainland continents, meaning any province in Britain or Ireland will not count. Unfinished colonies also don't count. An easy way to achieve this is to wait until one of the berber nations is without allies and noCB them. You can core Moroccan and Sus provinces with extended range from exploration ideas and the colonial range advisor. From there, you can keep eating North Africa, or go to West Africa. The provinces do not need to be cored.

*   [![No](/images/thumb/5/56/Ledger_no_crop.png/28px-Ledger_no_crop.png)](/File:Ledger_no_crop.png "No") No other country has a higher income than this country

One possible start is [![Flag of Norway](/images/thumb/0/0f/Norway.png/20px-Norway.png)](/Norway "Norway") [Norway](/Norway "Norway"). Stay as a vassal under [![Flag of Denmark](/images/thumb/6/69/Denmark.png/20px-Denmark.png)](/Denmark "Denmark") [Denmark](/Denmark "Denmark") for protection, rush expansion ideas, then get exploration after you reach diplomatic tech 7, and colonize Newfoundland from there, triggering the Grand Banks Fisheries which will power your colonial nation of Vinland. After Vinland forms, you can release and choose to play as them well within the time-frame of Denmark beginning integration, bypassing the PU. From there, expand and build as many manufactories as possible, swapping into Canada or Quebec's ideas, or even the USA. An important thing to note is that you can have a 10+ development province after the start of the campaign, but not during the month you're trying to count the highest income.

A great alternative start is [![Flag of Wolgast](/images/thumb/f/f6/Wolgast.png/20px-Wolgast.png)](/Wolgast "Wolgast") [Wolgast](/Wolgast "Wolgast"). Play the regular HRE game, expanding into Denmark and Russia.

Eventually, your income from flat 10 dev provinces will be the highest in the world, especially if you consider expanding into the west and taking control over the Channel. Keep all high dev provinces like Lübeck under vassals.

Another good variant is [![Flag of Kilwa](/images/thumb/c/cb/Kilwa.png/20px-Kilwa.png)](/Kilwa "Kilwa") [Kilwa](/Kilwa "Kilwa"). Having Feudalism makes your country a dominant power in region, and you can easily expand. Almost all conquered provinces have development below 11 dev, so you will not need to exploit them (it takes much time). You can get 5 provinces with gold at the start and another 2 in Ethiopia. Other provinces also have good resources like ivory. Also your home trade nodes (Zanzibar and Cape) are convenient for collecting – you can increase income by steering trade from India and Malacca. At the start you should rush to admin tech 5 and get colonists for colonizing coasts (especially Cape) before the Europeans.

The game does its check for highest income on every monthly tick meaning you could release nations from all your provinces with more than ten development and still get the achievement even if the next monthly tick would see your income drop tremendously as long as on the previous month tick, you had the highest income.

*   To form [![Flag of Jerusalem](/images/thumb/e/ef/Jerusalem.png/20px-Jerusalem.png)](/Jerusalem "Jerusalem") [Jerusalem](/Jerusalem "Jerusalem"), you need to get into coring range of Jerusalem area (vassalize an Italian minor and conquer a province next to it), own and state Jerusalem area, move capital to Arabia, Egypt or Mashriq and switch from [![Government republic.png](/images/thumb/5/5d/Government_republic.png/28px-Government_republic.png)](/Republic "Republic") Republic to [![Government monarchy.png](/images/thumb/4/4d/Government_monarchy.png/28px-Government_monarchy.png)](/Monarchy "Monarchy") Monarchy.
