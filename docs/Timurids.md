Shah Rukh is the supreme ruler of the Timurid Empire and the son of the great conqueror Timur.

Much has changed since the death of the Great Emir however, and his empire that once stretched from Anatolia to Delhi.

Shah Rukh has been able to keep most of Timur's empire together and patronized a thriving center of learning and arts in Herat, the pearl of Khorasan, but his reign is near its end and the aging ruler has fallen ill during the past year. In the outer provinces sons and grandsons are observing the court in Herat with great interest.

 [![Flag of Ajam](/images/thumb/d/df/Ajam.png/20px-Ajam.png)](/Ajam "Ajam") [Ajam](/Ajam "Ajam") under Muhammad bin Baysonqor is already independent in all but name. In Astarabad, [![Flag of Khorasan](/images/thumb/1/1d/Khorasan.png/20px-Khorasan.png)](/Khorasan "Khorasan") [Khorasan](/Khorasan "Khorasan"), his brother Babur has built a small power base for himself, no doubt with the only goal to have a base in the coming succession struggles. [![Flag of Transoxiana](/images/thumb/c/c3/Transoxiana.png/20px-Transoxiana.png)](/Transoxiana "Transoxiana") [Transoxiana](/Transoxiana "Transoxiana"), and Timur's own old capital Samarkand, has been left in the able hands of Ulugh Beg, son of our ruler and a great patron of the sciences and arts, while [![Flag of Fars](/images/thumb/a/ab/Fars.png/20px-Fars.png)](/Fars "Fars") [Fars](/Fars "Fars") is in the hands of a 12 year old prince of the dynasty.

Meanwhile the [![Flag of Qara Qoyunlu](/images/thumb/9/99/Qara_Qoyunlu.png/20px-Qara_Qoyunlu.png)](/Qara_Qoyunlu "Qara Qoyunlu") [Qara Qoyunlu](/Qara_Qoyunlu "Qara Qoyunlu") Federation has taken over many of the western parts of Timur's original empire and in southern Iraq the millenarian [![Flag of Mushasha](/images/thumb/0/0d/Mushasha.png/20px-Mushasha.png)](/Mushasha "Mushasha") [Mushasha](/Mushasha "Mushasha") have conquered Khuzestan and ousted the Timurid administrators from that region. The [![Flag of Uzbek](/images/thumb/7/73/Uzbek.png/20px-Uzbek.png)](/Uzbek "Uzbek") [Uzbeks](/Uzbek "Uzbek") are continually raiding our holdings in Transoxiana and our Indian governors have been ousted from [![Flag of Delhi](/images/thumb/d/d5/Delhi.png/20px-Delhi.png)](/Delhi "Delhi") [Delhi](/Delhi "Delhi").

As 1444 draws to an end the fate of the empire seems uncertain. Should Shah Rukh recover he may well rule for a number of years yet, but the tension is tangible, every son and grandson has been waiting for the moment of the emperor's death their entire lives…

In 1444, Timur, or Temūr-i Lang (aka Tamerlane) is long dead, but the remnants of his empire still control the Persian heartland. The **Timurids** are a Sunni [Iqta](/Iqta "Iqta") Empire. With [![Cradle of Civilization.png](/images/thumb/2/23/Cradle_of_Civilization.png/28px-Cradle_of_Civilization.png)](/Cradle_of_Civilization "Cradle of Civilization") Cradle of Civilization, they follow the [![Hanafi school](/images/thumb/a/a6/Muslim_school_hanafi.png/28px-Muslim_school_hanafi.png)](/Hanafi "Hanafi school") Hanafi school. Their position gives them easy access to the formation of [![Flag of Mughals](/images/thumb/e/e6/Mughals.png/20px-Mughals.png)](/Mughals "Mughals") [Mughals](/Mughals "Mughals") which they can do by conquering some of [![Flag of Delhi](/images/thumb/d/d5/Delhi.png/20px-Delhi.png)](/Delhi "Delhi") [Delhi](/Delhi "Delhi") and [![Flag of Jaunpur](/images/thumb/f/fc/Jaunpur.png/20px-Jaunpur.png)](/Jaunpur "Jaunpur") [Jaunpur](/Jaunpur "Jaunpur")'s starting territories.

The Timurids' starting position is precarious due to the high variation of the frequent revolts. Uniting the empire will be difficult, but will allow the Timurids to become a major player in world politics due to its powerful starting position and its access to Muslim [land units](/Land_units "Land units").

In the beginning of the game, the Timurids have many vassals : [![Flag of Transoxiana](/images/thumb/c/c3/Transoxiana.png/20px-Transoxiana.png)](/Transoxiana "Transoxiana") [Transoxiana](/Transoxiana "Transoxiana"), [![Flag of Sistan](/images/thumb/f/f5/Sistan.png/20px-Sistan.png)](/Sistan "Sistan") [Sistan](/Sistan "Sistan"), [![Flag of Afghanistan](/images/thumb/7/7d/Afghanistan.png/20px-Afghanistan.png)](/Afghanistan "Afghanistan") [Afghanistan](/Afghanistan "Afghanistan"), [![Flag of Fars](/images/thumb/a/ab/Fars.png/20px-Fars.png)](/Fars "Fars") [Fars](/Fars "Fars") and [![Flag of Khorasan](/images/thumb/1/1d/Khorasan.png/20px-Khorasan.png)](/Khorasan "Khorasan") [Khorasan](/Khorasan "Khorasan"). When Shah Rukh dies, all the vassals will have an additional 55% [liberty desire](/Liberty_desire "Liberty desire") due to lost modifiers, so it's difficult to maintain control over them.

Timurid events primarily deal with the dislocation of the empire: Shah Rukh, the starting ruler of the Timurids, has a ruler modifier providing [![Liberty desire in subjects](/images/thumb/5/55/Liberty_desire_in_subjects.png/24px-Liberty_desire_in_subjects.png)](/Liberty_desire "Liberty desire in subjects") **−50%** liberty desire in subjects.

_The aging ruler of the Timurid Empire, Shah Rukh, has been ill since the beginning of 1444. In his absence his wife, Goharshad, had taken over the daily rule of the empire but this sign of weakness has set wheels in motion among the princes that rule the Timurid provinces.  
  
In western Iran the young prince Muhammad Baysonqor, an ambitious grandson, has started to accept taxes and tokens of loyalty from a much larger region than his assigned governorate. Having finally recovered and learned of this insolence Shah Rukh has now declared Muhammad Baysonqor a rebel and is moving to strike at him at first opportunity.  
If a civil war among all sons and grandsons, like that at the end of Timurs life, is to be avoided Shah Rukh knows he must strike down any sign of rebellion harshly and quickly._

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![Strategy](/images/thumb/a/a2/Years_of_separatism.png/36px-Years_of_separatism.png "Strategy") _The below is **one of many** player suggested strategies for **Timurids**. Bear in mind, due to the dynamic nature of the game, it may unfold differently for other players._

### Initial position\[[edit](/index.php?title=Timurids&veaction=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Initial position") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Timurids&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Initial position")\]

The Timurids are in a tough position at the start of the game. After the death of the initial ruler, all their vassals will turn rebellious. Any player wishing to succeed as the Timurids should tackle this internal problem first, or else will likely face disaster.

In order to mitigate the loyalty penalty, the player should pass the Lenient Taxation Iqta modifier. Additionally, the [Strong Duchies](/Base_estates#Nobility_privileges "Base estates") Nobility estate privilege gives an extra -10% liberty desire, which helps reduce the penalty even further. The additional +2 diplomatic relations will allow you to make extra alliances in order to further discourage independence wars. After this, it's recommended to start a war with [![Flag of Ajam](/images/thumb/d/df/Ajam.png/20px-Ajam.png)](/Ajam "Ajam") [Ajam](/Ajam "Ajam") in order to weaken your vassals' armies and reclaim some of your cores, reducing their liberty desire even further. It's recommended to not use your own forces too much during wars, in order to maintain your power compared to your vassals. Instead, focus on building up and maintaining your forces. Continue declaring wars until you're able to annex your vassals. As long as they haven't gained any provinces, [![Flag of Fars](/images/thumb/a/ab/Fars.png/20px-Fars.png)](/Fars "Fars") [Fars](/Fars "Fars"), [![Flag of Khorasan](/images/thumb/1/1d/Khorasan.png/20px-Khorasan.png)](/Khorasan "Khorasan") [Khorasan](/Khorasan "Khorasan"), and [![Flag of Transoxiana](/images/thumb/c/c3/Transoxiana.png/20px-Transoxiana.png)](/Transoxiana "Transoxiana") [Transoxiana](/Transoxiana "Transoxiana") can all be annexed in one month, because all of their lands are Timurid cores. [![Flag of Afghanistan](/images/thumb/7/7d/Afghanistan.png/20px-Afghanistan.png)](/Afghanistan "Afghanistan") [Afghanistan](/Afghanistan "Afghanistan") and [![Flag of Sistan](/images/thumb/f/f5/Sistan.png/20px-Sistan.png)](/Sistan "Sistan") [Sistan](/Sistan "Sistan") will have to wait for later. The player should try to annex as many vassals at once as they can, because the -3 diplomatic reputation penalty doesn't stack.

Transoxiana has a few cores in provinces which are owned by Uzbek. These provinces can be conquered before annexing Transoxiana. Note that these cores are not Timurid cores, which makes the annexation procedure no longer instant. All of these cores are also cores of Kazakh, however, which can be fed them later if the player chooses to annex Transoxiana instantly.

Another possible strategy to deal with the vassals is to simply release them one at a time, until the remaining vassals are loyal. The player can then integrate the remaining vassals, and reconquer the vassals that were released earlier on. This strategy is extremely reliable, but if the player has some Ajami cores alongside the Iqta and Nobility bonuses it should not be necessary. If the player decides to use this strategy, avoid releasing Transoxiana as they will be hard to beat later on, or Sistan as the player does not start with any cores on them.

Another possible strategy is to declare war on Transoxiana with no cb while setting national focus on adm points. This way players avoid Transoxiana making allies and you can attack Transoxiana with your vassal swarm. Beware this strategy requires a lot of administrative points to raise stability and core provinces afterwards but this is the easiest strategy to deal with Transoxiana and has the most reliable outcome albeit costly mana wise. Player can use this strategy as soon as the starting ruler dies.

The easiest option is to get the Strong duchies estate privilege, use the iqta mechanics to get +1 diplo rep and -15% liberty desire. All your vassals are loyal until Shah Rukh dies. Build the grand company to lower their liberty desire even more. Declare war at Ajam on the 11.12.1444. Turn all your vassals to agressive. Shah Rukh will usually die during this war, but you can royal marry your vassals until the next month (their attitude does not change until then). You can improve your relations afterwards. It can also be a good thing to lower Transoxianas liberty desire with prestige. If your prestige is below zero, simply use patronate of the arts. When you have finished Ajam, full annex them. You can also take either their money or an additional core from Luristan. You now have seven vassals, but if you stated all your territories from Ajam and build some more armys to go up to 40k troops to fulfill the mission that gives claims in India, they all should be loyal. If your new vassals are still a bit disloyal, just improve relations with them. After conquering some territories in India, you can even give out the integration privilege and annex the vassals you have cores on all of their territory (Transoxiana, Fars, Khorasan).

When the vassals are under control and annexed, the player has a lot of options. If the player manages to stabilize, the Timurids will be one of the strongest powers in the region with the potential to become one of the strongest countries. By conquering Delhi the Timurids can form the Mughals, who get strong national ideas and missions to conquer much of India alongside extra bonuses for conquering culture groups. The player could also choose to go north and conquer the steppes of Asia, or go west to try and fight the Ottomans.

A good option is also not to rush to form Mughals but finish the Timurids missions providing permanent claims (if any remain). Then after forming the Mughals and completing the Pacify Punjab mission, the Mughals get missions providing claims on Persia and central Asia steppes (Afghan Frontier and Abu Said's Dream). If the player wants to push into the west, it's best to conquer Persia, Basra and Gulf of Aden trade nodes before the Ottomans can do it. The player doesn't necessarily have to conquer every province but rather conquer the provinces bordering with Aleppo and Crimea trade node as quickly as possible. Then the player can move onto conquering Arabia. The rest of the landlocked provinces can then be conquered later on as the Ottomans won't be able to do it. Although the Timurid and Mughal missions both grant claims on lucrative Indian provinces, it's often beneficial in the long run to wage war against the Ottomans directly before they annex Egypt and snowball out of control. Even if the empire is stretched too thin to annex the Ottomans, ensuring that they are saddled with war exhaustion and debt can delay their power spikes by several decades.

### Diplomacy\[[edit](/index.php?title=Timurids&veaction=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Diplomacy") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Timurids&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Diplomacy")\]

With the Strong Duchies estate privilege and Timurid traditions, the player has an incredible 7 diplomatic relations to work with. Securing two allies in addition to your five vassals won't lower the vassals' liberty desire, but it will greatly reduce their willingness to make alliances with each other and outside powers. [![Flag of Chagatai](/images/thumb/d/d5/Chagatai.png/20px-Chagatai.png)](/Chagatai "Chagatai") [Chagatai](/Chagatai "Chagatai") is an optimal ally, as they start with the powerful Nomadic units and a loyal vassal of their own. The seventh slot is often best spent on a strong Indian nation, such as [![Flag of Jaunpur](/images/thumb/f/fc/Jaunpur.png/20px-Jaunpur.png)](/Jaunpur "Jaunpur") [Jaunpur](/Jaunpur "Jaunpur") or [![Flag of Gujarat](/images/thumb/5/53/Gujarat.png/20px-Gujarat.png)](/Gujarat "Gujarat") [Gujarat](/Gujarat "Gujarat"), and this alliance can be broken later in order to take claims on the subcontinent. This will make Timurid vassals less likely to declare an independence war.

A riskier choice is the [![Flag of Ottomans](/images/thumb/8/89/Ottomans.png/20px-Ottomans.png)](/Ottomans "Ottomans") [Ottomans](/Ottomans "Ottomans"), whose incredible power can be leveraged against the Timurids' western enemies. They will be especially helpful in wars against Qara Qoyunlu and the Mamluks. The objective of an alliance with the Ottomans should be to cut them off from expanding out from Anatolia, particularly into Egypt. If you manage to keep the Ottomans as a long time ally and their eastward expansion is blocked, they will instead push into Europe. They can be used as an excellent battering ram against Russia and increasing warscore in wars with European colonizers or any nations buying provinces in Africa/Asia. At the very least, an Ottoman ally is better than an Ottoman enemy until the Timurids can centralize and develop a rich Indian power base. If the Ottomans are hostile, or their expansion goes unchecked for too long, it's best to use their enemies - often [![Flag of France](/images/thumb/d/de/France.png/20px-France.png)](/France "France") [France](/France "France") or [![Flag of Commonwealth](/images/thumb/d/df/Commonwealth.png/20px-Commonwealth.png)](/Commonwealth "Commonwealth") [Commonwealth](/Commonwealth "Commonwealth") - to form an alliance bloc against them. Keep in mind that the Timurids cannot ally [![Flag of Uzbek](/images/thumb/7/73/Uzbek.png/20px-Uzbek.png)](/Uzbek "Uzbek") [Uzbek](/Uzbek "Uzbek") or the [![Flag of Mamluks](/images/thumb/c/ca/The_Mamluks.png/20px-The_Mamluks.png)](/Mamluks "Mamluks") [Mamluks](/Mamluks "Mamluks"), as they are historical rivals, but a player who forms the Mughals can leverage both of these alliances.

Western and Central Asia are very good places to feed vassals. Conquering a single [![Flag of Kazakh](/images/thumb/1/15/Kazakh.png/20px-Kazakh.png)](/Kazakh "Kazakh") [Kazakh](/Kazakh "Kazakh") core and then releasing them as a subject gives you a loyal vassal with permanent cores on most of Uzbek and parts of Nogai and Chagatai. A [![Flag of Syria](/images/thumb/0/0f/Syria.png/20px-Syria.png)](/Syria "Syria") [Syria](/Syria "Syria") vassal has claims on some very underrated land, with Damascus (Sham) being an extremely rich province. Horde politics are chaotic, and countries like the [![Flag of Great Horde](/images/thumb/b/b7/Great_Horde.png/20px-Great_Horde.png)](/Great_Horde "Great Horde") [Great Horde](/Great_Horde "Great Horde") and [![Flag of Qara Qoyunlu](/images/thumb/9/99/Qara_Qoyunlu.png/20px-Qara_Qoyunlu.png)](/Qara_Qoyunlu "Qara Qoyunlu") [Qara Qoyunlu](/Qara_Qoyunlu "Qara Qoyunlu") can collapse and be reformed as a vassal under the player. These countries are a great way to prevent rebellions and reduce strain on administrative power. The player can ally [![Flag of Kazan](/images/thumb/3/33/Kazan.png/20px-Kazan.png)](/Kazan "Kazan") [Kazan](/Kazan "Kazan") or [![Flag of Nogai](/images/thumb/3/32/Nogai.png/20px-Nogai.png)](/Nogai "Nogai") [Nogai](/Nogai "Nogai") to prevent Muscovite expansion into the steppes, but letting these nations collapse until they can be peacefully vassalized and fed their cores back is a powerful alternative strategy.

While expanding into southeast Asia, Tibet or Mongolia, a war against Ming is inevitable. If Russia is not blocked from expanding into Siberia, it is just a matter of time when both superpowers start to clash. You can use this opportunity to declare war on either one of them or one of Ming's tributaries. If Russia is taken down a peg by the player, Poland, or Denmark, an alliance with the strongest Jurchen tribe can act as insurance that wars with Ming go smoothly.

  

### Trade\[[edit](/index.php?title=Timurids&veaction=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Trade") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Timurids&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Trade")\]

Persia is a surprisingly powerful trade node in Europa Universalis IV. With 4 centers of trade and an estuary, a player who controls all of the provinces there will lose almost no money to a Russia or Ottomans who attempts to siphon trade away to Astrakhan or Aleppo, respectively. The Timurids and Transoxiana together hold almost all of the trade in Samarkand, ensuring a steady flow of profit as soon as the latter is annexed. Furthermore, the Timurids and Mughals get free claims across the Lahore node, which is extremely productive and steers to Persia. Note that, after forming the Mughals, the player will need to move their home trade port from Delhi back to Persia. Even as the Mughals, this decision is worth it, and trade from across India can be diverted to Persia for maximum profits.

Trade Ideas are strongly recommended to be able to direct trade from Basra, Gulf of Aden, Samarkand and India into Persia. Maximizing profits from this strategy involves blocking Ottoman expansion into Egypt, or at least preventing them from getting a port on the Indian Ocean. The Ottomans won't be able to colonize or buy provinces in India and South East Asia, thus the player is free to monopolize the spice trade instead.

Due to there being only two Centers of Trade in Samarkand - one of which starts under Chagatai control - conquering as much land as possible within the node is required in order to keep the trade flow into Persia secured.

Conquest of African land outside ports and centers of trade should not be considered a priority. Mughals can instead keep a vassal or march there and feed it the East African interior.

Taking Alexandria and keeping the trade power there is extremely difficult as half of Europe will usually steer trade out of the node. It is much easier to hold Gulf of Aden and Basra and try to steer trade into Persia and collect trade in Cape of Good Hope by using enough trade ships. Most of the wealth routed from India and Spice Islands can then be securely steered into the Persia node, with not much flowing into Europe. Indian Ocean trade can be fully monopolized by holding the Cape of Good Hope node, ensuring that said trade cannot be diverted to Europe by any means. However, this will require war with a colonizer, and thus a heavy naval investment.

With rich trade routes secured and a war or two waged against each of Russia and the Ottomans, the world is the player's bright red (or forest green) oyster. There should be sufficient wealth in the realm to conquer Ming or Qing, if either exists, and unify Asia under one banner.
