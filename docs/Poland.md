![Shield Poland.png](/images/thumb/4/4a/Shield_Poland.png/130px-Shield_Poland.png)

When Wladyslaw III fell in the battle of Varna both Poland and [![Flag of Hungary](/images/thumb/6/6a/Hungary.png/20px-Hungary.png)](/Hungary "Hungary") [Hungary](/Hungary "Hungary") were robbed of their kings in one stroke. Without leadership it is now up to the nobles of the realm to appoint a new ruler. The most natural successor, Kazimierz Jagiellon, has been made Grand Duke of [![Flag of Lithuania](/images/thumb/d/d9/Lithuania.png/20px-Lithuania.png)](/Lithuania "Lithuania") [Lithuania](/Lithuania "Lithuania") 4 years prior. Crowning him would, however, require reaching an agreement that is acceptable to both Kazimierz, the Lithuanian and the Polish nobles.

Ever since the 1392 the two states have been bound together by a series of agreements seeking to integrate the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Kingdom of Poland in order to allow them to present a united front against their common enemies: the Knights of the [![Flag of Teutonic Order](/images/thumb/2/2f/Teutonic_Order.png/20px-Teutonic_Order.png)](/Teutonic_Order "Teutonic Order") [Teutonic](/Teutonic_Order "Teutonic Order") and [![Flag of Livonian Order](/images/thumb/8/81/Livonian_Order.png/20px-Livonian_Order.png)](/Livonian_Order "Livonian Order") [Livonian Orders](/Livonian_Order "Livonian Order"), the Tatars of the [![Flag of Golden Horde](/images/thumb/6/62/Golden_Horde.png/20px-Golden_Horde.png)](/Golden_Horde "Golden Horde") [Golden Horde](/Golden_Horde "Golden Horde") and the [![Flag of Crimea](/images/thumb/6/64/Crimea.png/20px-Crimea.png)](/Crimea "Crimea") [Crimean Khanate](/Crimea "Crimea"), and the Russian Principalities, lead by [![Flag of Muscovy](/images/thumb/4/41/Muscovy.png/20px-Muscovy.png)](/Muscovy "Muscovy") [Muscovy](/Muscovy "Muscovy") in the north west. This cooperation has allowed the two countries to thrive despite their many enemies, but integrating the nobility of two such divergent states has not been an easy matter. Among both the Polish and the Lithuanian nobility there are some, the Magnates, who control very large estates and command great political influence. These families are in some ways the financial and political backbone of their states, but they are also a power factor that even kings might think twice before rejecting.

While large parts of their lands are sparsely populated there is little doubt that Poland and Lithuania could be among the most powerful states in Europe if they go forward with their integration. Their enemies are however quite formidable. In the far south the [![Flag of Ottomans](/images/thumb/8/89/Ottomans.png/20px-Ottomans.png)](/Ottomans "Ottomans") [Ottoman](/Ottomans "Ottomans") Empire seems to be at the gates of Hungary, ready to expand up the flow of the Danube. To the north the highly militarized Teutonic Order consider the two states its main enemy. An uneasy agreement has been reached with the Knights following the Lithuanian Civil War, by which all parties agreed to recognize both the existing borders and the Polish-Lithuanian king. Perhaps most dangerous of them all however, is the Grand Duchy of Muscovy in the far north east. The Muscovites are rapidly creating a strong and expansive state to challenge the Lithuanian overlordship over the Ruthenian and Russian peoples that inhabit most of the Grand Duchy...

_Main article: [Polish missions](/Polish_missions "Polish missions")_  

Poland's missions are focused on the integration of its vassals, developing the country, maintaining friendly relations with [![Flag of Lithuania](/images/thumb/d/d9/Lithuania.png/20px-Lithuania.png)](/Lithuania "Lithuania") [Lithuania](/Lithuania "Lithuania"), and the subjugation and conquest of its neighboring rivals: the [![Flag of Teutonic Order](/images/thumb/2/2f/Teutonic_Order.png/20px-Teutonic_Order.png)](/Teutonic_Order "Teutonic Order") [Teutonic Order](/Teutonic_Order "Teutonic Order"), the [![Flag of Ottomans](/images/thumb/8/89/Ottomans.png/20px-Ottomans.png)](/Ottomans "Ottomans") [Ottomans](/Ottomans "Ottomans") and [![Flag of Russia](/images/thumb/e/ee/Russia.png/20px-Russia.png)](/Russia "Russia") [Russia](/Russia "Russia").

_Main article: [Polish events](/Polish_events "Polish events")_  

Poland's events are heavily focused on the internal structure and stability of the Polish state, characterized by a long term struggle to assert control over the nobles of the Sejm, as well as the integration of the Duchy of [Mazovia](/Mazovia "Mazovia") and Grand Duchy of [Lithuania](/Lithuania "Lithuania") into the Polish-Lithuanian [Commonwealth](/Commonwealth "Commonwealth"). Outside of its borders, Poland is faced with events that characterize the tensions between the [Ottomans](/Ottomans "Ottomans") and an independent [Sweden](/Sweden "Sweden"). A small number of events address Poland's position at the heart of Europe, right along the border of the Holy Roman shift towards Protestantism.

Two events chains allow Poland to get new vassals. [Moldavia](/Moldavia "Moldavia") has events that can lead to it becoming a Polish March, and the [Teutonic Order](/Teutonic_Order "Teutonic Order") has events leading to the revolt of the Prussian Confederation ([Danzig](/Danzig "Danzig")), which becomes a Polish vassal if Poland supports them in their war against the Order.

Strategy\[[edit](/index.php?title=Poland&veaction=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Strategy") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Poland&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Strategy")\]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![Strategy](/images/thumb/a/a2/Years_of_separatism.png/36px-Years_of_separatism.png "Strategy") _The below is **one of many** player suggested strategies for **Poland**. Bear in mind, due to the dynamic nature of the game, it may unfold differently for other players._

**Poland** starts the game without a king and there is little it can do, however soon the event _“[Successor of Wladyslaw III](/Polish_events#flavor_pol.18 "Polish events")”_ will fire, allowing Poland to form a [personal union](/Personal_union "Personal union") over [![Flag of Lithuania](/images/thumb/d/d9/Lithuania.png/20px-Lithuania.png)](/Lithuania "Lithuania") [Lithuania](/Lithuania "Lithuania"). The player can chose to take a powerful local king instead for an alternative game, but to become the most powerful it is best to take the PU. With a ruler and a powerful junior partner, Poland can now start attacking its many foes. To the west there is the Holy Roman Empire, to the north there is the declining [![Flag of Teutonic Order](/images/thumb/2/2f/Teutonic_Order.png/20px-Teutonic_Order.png)](/Teutonic_Order "Teutonic Order") [Teutonic Order](/Teutonic_Order "Teutonic Order"), to the south there is the powerful [![Flag of Hungary](/images/thumb/6/6a/Hungary.png/20px-Hungary.png)](/Hungary "Hungary") [Hungary](/Hungary "Hungary"), and to the east, beyond Lithuania, there is [![Flag of Muscovy](/images/thumb/4/41/Muscovy.png/20px-Muscovy.png)](/Muscovy "Muscovy") [Muscovy](/Muscovy "Muscovy") and the successor states of the Golden Horde.

The [Holy Roman Empire](/Holy_Roman_Empire "Holy Roman Empire") can be a difficult foe to tackle, as the emperor will defend its tiny states. However, by allying as many electors as possible and directly attacking the emperor, it is possible to dismantle the HRE in a few years from game start. This opens up an easy route for expansion. The princes, without protection of the emperor, can be conquered one by one with little trouble. However, the initial war can be difficult, making this a recommended route for veteran players only.

 [![Flag of Bohemia](/images/thumb/4/41/Bohemia.png/20px-Bohemia.png)](/Bohemia "Bohemia") [Bohemia](/Bohemia "Bohemia") can also be acquired early as a PU subject if the player is lucky. For this to happen the event that gives you a king must fire early while Bohemia is still in an interregnum, Austria must rival Bohemia and Bohemia must be friendly to you. Then as soon as you have a king, marry Bohemia, wait for your dynasty to take the Bohemian throne, then immediately claim their throne and go to war. Since Austria rivaled Bohemia they are willing to let you conquer Bohemia without defending them. However, this is very luck dependent and will require multiple restarts.

A safer route that can be taken is going east first, set the [![Flag of Great Horde](/images/thumb/b/b7/Great_Horde.png/20px-Great_Horde.png)](/Great_Horde "Great Horde") [Great Horde](/Great_Horde "Great Horde") as rival and attack them. Humiliate them and take money to complete the age objective and generate power projection. Next Poland can launch a war of humiliation on [![Flag of Novgorod](/images/thumb/5/5e/Novgorod.png/20px-Novgorod.png)](/Novgorod "Novgorod") [Novgorod](/Novgorod "Novgorod"). Usually they are already beaten down by Muscovy taking her core back. All the player has to do is move in and quickly full siege the country, only defeating the remnants of the Novgorodian army. With the humiliation casus belli, it is possible to select _show strength_ in the peace treaty. This will give power projection and +100 monarchy points in every category. With the power projection and this extra 300 MP, Poland can start teching up and recover from the first few months of a regency council.

Around this time the Prussian confederacy event fires, releasing [![Flag of Danzig](/images/thumb/4/4e/Danzig.png/20px-Danzig.png)](/Danzig "Danzig") [Danzig](/Danzig "Danzig") from the Teutonic Order as an independent state. Choose to support them, even if the war with Novgorod is still not completed. As soon as there are no more enemy troops in north, move most of your army south to defeat the Teutons while leaving siege stacks in the Novgorod to finish them off. In the mission tree it is possible to turn Danzig into a vassal once the war is completed. [![Flag of Moldavia](/images/thumb/5/59/Moldavia.png/20px-Moldavia.png)](/Moldavia "Moldavia") [Moldavia](/Moldavia "Moldavia") will also ask for help, send manpower or money to them, and there is a chance they will become a march of Poland.

Now Poland has truces with most of her neighbors, it is a good time to recover manpower and money. It is also advisable to annex Danzig and [![Flag of Mazovia](/images/thumb/e/ee/Mazovia.png/20px-Mazovia.png)](/Mazovia "Mazovia") [Mazovia](/Mazovia "Mazovia") to free up diplomatic relation slots. With the elective monarch mechanic Poland will have kings from foreign nations on her throne. If these nations themselves lack an heir or have an heir with a weak claim, it is possible to form personal unions over them by claiming their throne. Make sure to be on a lookout for these opportunities. Especially [![Flag of Austria](/images/thumb/7/7f/Austria.png/20px-Austria.png)](/Austria "Austria") [Austria](/Austria "Austria") with her high diplomatic reputation often gets their dynasty on your throne. With Polish lands being relatively low in development and far removed from Italy, it can be tempting to develop the renaissance on your own. At the one hand this will offer cheaper technology, earlier access to the Polish renaissance mission, and a highly developed province. Poland gets the option to move their capital via a decision, this creates a second capital to develop another institution at and it can then spread to a high dev Krakow to fulfill the 10% development requirement when Poland is big. At the other hand, most of Poland's opponents will be similarly behind on technology, so letting it spread naturally is not too painful.

Once the truce with the Teutonic Order has run out it is possible to attack them again, they have the _[historical rival](/Historical_rival "Historical rival")_ modifier on them, but an event will fire if they are vassalized, removing this modifier. If relation slots and diplomatic points are a struggle however, it is more beneficial to annex their lands directly. With [diplomatic ideas](/Diplomatic_ideas "Diplomatic ideas") unlocked up to “Flexible Negotiations” and the “Transfer Subject” age ability, it is possible to take away [![Flag of Sweden](/images/thumb/9/98/Sweden.png/20px-Sweden.png)](/Sweden "Sweden") [Sweden](/Sweden "Sweden") from [![Flag of Denmark](/images/thumb/6/69/Denmark.png/20px-Denmark.png)](/Denmark "Denmark") [Denmark](/Denmark "Denmark"). This war can be started before the idea and age ability are unlocked, as you only need to have them available once the war is concluded and you need to negotiate the peace deal. The war is difficult. The attrition in the northern provinces is high and Denmark and her junior partners control the waters. Having [![Flag of Austria](/images/thumb/7/7f/Austria.png/20px-Austria.png)](/Austria "Austria") [Austria](/Austria "Austria") as an ally can help here, they usually rival Denmark. Waiting for military tech 7 to get some cannons for the sieges can also make this war easier. If the war turns bad, you can also settle stealing [![Flag of Norway](/images/thumb/0/0f/Norway.png/20px-Norway.png)](/Norway "Norway") [Norway](/Norway "Norway") from Denmark. If the war was started early enough, and the reformation is late enough, it is possible to wait out the truce and start another war with Denmark to take the other junior partner for yourself before the age of discovery is over.

Once manpower is recovered Poland can look to fight some of its biggest rivals. To the east Muscovy will fight the hordes, such as [![Flag of Kazan](/images/thumb/3/33/Kazan.png/20px-Kazan.png)](/Kazan "Kazan") [Kazan](/Kazan "Kazan"), the [![Flag of Great Horde](/images/thumb/b/b7/Great_Horde.png/20px-Great_Horde.png)](/Great_Horde "Great Horde") [Great Horde](/Great_Horde "Great Horde") and [![Flag of Uzbek](/images/thumb/7/73/Uzbek.png/20px-Uzbek.png)](/Uzbek "Uzbek") [Uzbek](/Uzbek "Uzbek"). By setting the Russian provinces that border Lithuania as provinces of interest, Lithuania will fabricate claims on them. When Muscovy fights one of the hordes, a great opportunity opens up to attack them. In this peace deal you can feed Lithuania some provinces, but be careful you do not give Lithuania too many. If they are too big you cannot pass the [form commonwealth decision](/Commonwealth#Form_Polish-Lithuanian_Commonwealth_.28Poland.29 "Commonwealth"). If Novgorod has been wiped from the map, take a province from which you can release Novgorod as a vassal. This opens up a massive reconquest war opportunity. If Muscovy is too strong, attack the weakened hordes instead and take land around the black sea. This is steppe terrain and can be given to the cossacks to improve your cavalry. Another option is the [![Flag of Ottomans](/images/thumb/8/89/Ottomans.png/20px-Ottomans.png)](/Ottomans "Ottomans") [Ottomans](/Ottomans "Ottomans"), they are a powerful foe, but if they are locked in battle with someone like the [![Flag of Mamluks](/images/thumb/c/ca/The_Mamluks.png/20px-The_Mamluks.png)](/Mamluks "Mamluks") [Mamluks](/Mamluks "Mamluks"), an attack from the back can deal critical damage. Once again, Austria can provide invaluable aid, they can siege down the Balkans, while Polish troops can reach around the black sea and strike into the Anatolian heartland. Fortifications in Moldavia (if acquired as a march) and around the Caucasus (if conquered beforehand) can limit the ability of the Ottomans to invade Poland. Loans are not an issue, as the Ottomans are rich and you can take a lot of money in a peace deal.

Around this time the reformation starts in Germany. This weakens the empire and if it was not dismantled at the start, it can be done now to open up another front. Alternatively you can just take some of the northern land that is part of the Lubeck tradenode. Denmark without its partners can now also be conquered to secure the trade node. Poland has a weak economy with poor starting trade and low development lands, but once the tradenode of Lubeck is secure and the age ability “Polish Crown” is taken Poland will hit a new era of prosperity. Use this wealth to meddle in European affairs, deal with Muscovy or the Ottomans, or maybe gain another throne from a foreign dynasty that was foolish enough to take your throne. You can also join the holy league war, but be careful that the Ottomans and Russians can join the other side, and crush you in a pincer movement.

The player gets the option to form the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth at administrative level ten. This allows the Polish player to annex Lithuania free of charge. This decision will weaken the country, as two countries together are stronger than one, but it will free up a diplomatic relation slot. This slot can be filled by using the restore union casus belli you gain from the mission when you reform the PLC. Sweden and Norway can also be annexed if taken. Norway can provide colonies if subsidized, but otherwise will provide little value. Sweden has powerful military ideas to act as a strong fighting vassal, but annexing them gives you full possession of the Baltic sea trade node. Moldavia is rather small and is often better off being annexed. If diplomatic ideas are chosen revoking their march status does not cost stability.

As the 16th century closes, it is recommended to halt expansion and instead focus on building up a military, gain a decent manpower reserve and have low unrest. From 1600 onward a bad event will happen, where you either become a noble republic, or become a hereditary monarchy. If one chooses the path of the monarchy, massive amounts of rebels will spawn that need to be put down. If done successfully an achievement is earned. From this point onward the dynasty is set as the last dynasty that elected their monarch to your throne. Having a powerful dynasty, such as that of the French or Austrians, makes sure that at some point in the future you can claim their throne for your own. While this cannot be fully controlled, good relations will increase the rate at which they push their heir.

From this point onward the player is free to destroy the Ottomans, break the Rus, and meddle in the affairs of the Germans.

### Idea groups\[[edit](/index.php?title=Poland&veaction=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Idea groups") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Poland&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Idea groups")\]

The Polish can make use of many ideas.

For administrative ideas, humanist ideas are a great early idea group. Poland will have to contend with many different religions. From Orthodox in the east to Protestantism in the west to the Muslim faith in the south.

In the diplomatic ideas group, diplomatic ideas open up many possibilities early on. The extra diplomats can help with improving relations, managing vassals, and fabricating spy networks. The extra diplomatic relation slot helps with the many subject countries that are thrust upon Poland. The diplomatic reputation helps Poland to easily royal marry countries that put their dynasty on the Polish throne so their throne can be claimed, it helps with keeping vassals loyal, and makes annexing vassals faster. The flexible negotiations allow Poland to take Sweden from Denmark in the age of discovery. However, Poland may be starved for diplomatic monarch points early on, making it difficult to complete this idea group.

Influence ideas, similar to diplomatic ideas, will strengthen Poland's ability in diplomacy and make her vassal swarm a lot stronger, and cheaper to annex.

Espionage ideas normally are considered weak, but for Poland, they can be interesting. The aggressive expansion impact is amazing. They allow Poland to use her full power for more conquest, before having to slow down for the fear of a coalition. The corruption reduction helps with the corruption from territories malus. But most interesting is the policy that unlocks when combined with aristocratic ideas. This adds 20% cavalry combat ability, combined with their national ideas which make the winged hussars a force of destruction. If the Ottomans or Russians prove to be too strong for Poland, juicing up the horses with this policy will shatter the enemies of the commonwealth.

Later on, trade ideas can be picked up to steer the trade from the vast stretches of land into the trade capital in Lubeck or the Baltic sea.

For military ideas, aristocratic ideas prove to be useful. The Polish can make good use of the cavalry powerup, and the leader siege and extra manpower both help the Poles a lot in their endeavors. Together with espionage ideas it also gives a powerful cavalry policy. Quality can further boost the cavalry to make them atomize whomever they are unleashed upon.

### Forming Prussia as Poland\[[edit](/index.php?title=Poland&veaction=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Forming Prussia as Poland") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Poland&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Forming Prussia as Poland")\]

As an alternative to forming Commonwealth, Poland might go another route and form [![Flag of Prussia](/images/thumb/2/28/Prussia.png/20px-Prussia.png)](/Prussia "Prussia") [Prussia](/Prussia "Prussia") and later [![Flag of Germany](/images/thumb/9/9b/Germany.png/20px-Germany.png)](/Germany "Germany") [Germany](/Germany "Germany").

This can be done by supporting Danzig, making them a vassal via the mission tree and integrating them. One should hold off integrating Mazovia for now. When all Prussian land is annexed, one can develop provinces, culture convert non-prussian provinces or sell provinces to Mazovia or Lithuania. [![Flag of Riga](/images/thumb/4/4c/Riga.png/20px-Riga.png)](/Riga "Riga") [Riga](/Riga "Riga") can be annexed for even more Prussian provinces. Otherwise the strategy follows the ordinary Poland strategy.

When Prussian makes up 50% of the land, one can culture convert to Prussian and then safely annex Mazovia and complete that part of the mission tree.

You will spend a lot of monarch points developing provinces, so one will be behind in tech, so direct conflict with big powerful nations might be dangerous.

Before forming Prussia make sure to complete the Polish Renaissance mission to get one of the best advisors in the game, Nicolas Copernicus.
