Expansion features\[[edit](/index.php?title=Leviathan&veaction=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Expansion features") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Leviathan&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Expansion features")\]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Picture a capital city that shines like a gemstone, improved by the wealth drawn from the hinterland - decorated by riches demanded from vassals. A capital not of a mighty territorial empire, but of a compact and concentrated state that can still use gold and favors to influence neighbors and rivals. Picture it and then make it so in _Europa Universalis IV: Leviathan_.

Get new tools to centralize and accumulate power for your country. New diplomatic actions give you the means to go up against mightier counterparts and new economic tools will allow you to establish rich vassal empires that draw wealth and development to your monumental capital city. _Leviathan_ also brings new improvements to other core areas of the game, such as colonies and regencies.

*   **Ask for Favors**: Curry favors with other nations and use them to advance diplomatic goals.
*   **New Regency Options**: Regency councils represent the interests of the most powerful estate, and can be extended to delay the ascension of an unfit monarch.
*   **Specialized Colonial Nations**: Let your colonies focus on military help, trade power or self-government.
*   **Concentrate Development**: You can now steal development from your vassals or territorial possessions to enhance the power of your capital city.
*   **Pillage Capital**: Loot an enemy capital as a condition of peace, hauling development back to the capital metropolis.
*   **Expand Infrastructure**: Provinces can expand their capacity to build new structures and manufactories, allowing smaller nations to create centers of wealth for a modest cost.
*   **Centralize State**: Reduce the cost of government by spending unused Reform points.
*   **Totemism**: Nations that follow the Totemist religion can revere a pantheon of past leaders, earning bonuses that reflect the skills they had in life.
*   **[Monuments](/Monument "Monument")**: Expand and establish great projects, adding new bonuses to your empire.
*   **New Unit Models**: New army sprites for Southeast Asian nations, including Indochinese, Indonesian and Polynesian nations.
*   **And more**: Including the ability to carpet siege enemy provinces, draft transports as a plutocratic nation, watch heirs gain legitimacy as they wait to inherit the throne and other changes.

Free features\[[edit](/index.php?title=Leviathan&veaction=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Free features") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Leviathan&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Free features")\]

*   Rework to the Southeast Asian and Australasian maps.

### Cinematic trailers\[[edit](/index.php?title=Leviathan&veaction=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Cinematic trailers") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Leviathan&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Cinematic trailers")\]

_**Europa Universalis IV: Leviathan story trailer**_. Not everything has to be brute force. Armies are necessary, of course, but there are other ways to succeed. Build a force of diplomats, for example, and use your flattery as a weapon against others. Or draw wealth and power from the remote regions of your realm to construct a metropolis to be the engine of your economy. Try many new routes to global power in Europa Universalis IV: Leviathan.

_**Europa Universalis IV: Leviathan announcement trailer**_. The expansion offers new tools that allow you to play "tall" with smaller and more focused realms with a few centers of power. It also has a host of other changes to well-established game features like regencies and colonies.
