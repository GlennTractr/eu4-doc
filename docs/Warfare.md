_**EU4 Beginner Tutorial #4 - War**_. A complete beginner tutorial with _MordredViking_ looking at how warfare works in the game.

**Warfare** is one of the primary ways to obtain territory and other concessions from other nations. The technical aspects of maintaining a military machine and its employment on the field is discussed in-depth in the articles [land warfare](/Land_warfare "Land warfare") and [naval warfare](/Naval_warfare "Naval warfare").

Like most diplomatic actions, declaring war requires a [diplomat](/Diplomat "Diplomat"). War may not be declared on an ally, a subject, a guaranteed nation or a nation transferring you commercial power without first breaking that relation.

### Casus belli\[[edit](/index.php?title=Warfare&veaction=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Casus belli") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Warfare&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Casus belli")\]

_Main article: [Casus belli](/Casus_belli "Casus belli")_  

The aggressor may pick a casus belli when declaring war. This determines the wargoal, the options available in the subsequent peace deal, and their associated costs in warscore, aggressive expansion, and diplomatic power.

[![](/images/thumb/d/d7/Declare_war.png/400px-Declare_war.png)](/File:Declare_war.png)

[](/File:Declare_war.png "Enlarge")

Declaring War with a Casus belli

### No casus belli\[[edit](/index.php?title=Warfare&veaction=edit&section=3 "Edit section: No casus belli") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Warfare&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: No casus belli")\]

Declaring war without a casus belli will result in **\-20** [![Aggressive expansion impact.png](/images/thumb/c/ca/Aggressive_expansion_impact.png/28px-Aggressive_expansion_impact.png)](/Aggressive_expansion_impact "Aggressive expansion impact") [aggressive expansion](/Aggressive_expansion "Aggressive expansion"), a **\-2** drop in [![Stability.png](/images/a/ae/Stability.png)](/Stability "Stability") [stability](/Stability "Stability"), and **+2** [![War exhaustion.png](/images/8/8c/War_exhaustion.png)](/War_exhaustion "War exhaustion") [war exhaustion](/War_exhaustion "War exhaustion"). These penalties are halved with full [Diplomatic ideas](/Diplomatic_ideas "Diplomatic ideas").

### Good relations\[[edit](/index.php?title=Warfare&veaction=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Good relations") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Warfare&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Good relations")\]

A country declaring war on another whose opinion of them is higher than **100** will cause **\-1** stability and **+1** war exhaustion. If opinion is higher than **150**, penalty increases to **\-2** stability and **+2** war exhaustion.

### Co-belligerence\[[edit](/index.php?title=Warfare&veaction=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Co-belligerence") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Warfare&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Co-belligerence")\]

If a country is _not_ marked as a co-belligerent:

*   That country can't call its allies to arms in that war (but its subjects are called as normal). Beware that the Holy Roman Emperor defending the empire is always a co-belligerent.
*   Taking that country's provinces in a peace incurs [![Aggressive expansion impact.png](/images/thumb/c/ca/Aggressive_expansion_impact.png/28px-Aggressive_expansion_impact.png)](/Aggressive_expansion_impact "Aggressive expansion impact") **+50%** aggressive expansion and costs [![War score.png](/images/thumb/b/b3/War_score.png/28px-War_score.png)](/War_score "War score") **+100%** warscore.

If a country _is_ marked as a co-belligerent:

*   That country can call on its own allies to fight as well
*   If that country has a [guarantor](/Diplomacy#Proclaim_guarantee "Diplomacy"), it is also called to war
*   Taking that country's provinces will cost the same as the war leader's provinces

Note: If a nation _is_ marked as a co-belligerent, but are also a tributary of another nation, neither the tributary overlord, nor the co-belligerent's allies will be called in. A similar loophole also applies in the HRE. If a free city or an HRE member is marked as a co-belligerent neither the Emperor nor the Emperor's allies will be called in. But in this case the allies of the co-belligerent will be called.

### Things you cannot do while being at war\[[edit](/index.php?title=Warfare&veaction=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Things you cannot do while being at war") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Warfare&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Things you cannot do while being at war")\]

Note that while your country is at war you cannot do quite a lot of things:

*   [Abdicate ruler](/Ruler#Abdication "Ruler")
*   [Seize estate lands](/Estates#Seize_land "Estates")
*   [Reduce local autonomy](/Local_autonomy#Changing_autonomy "Local autonomy") in provinces
*   Upgrade or downgrade [Centers of Trade](/Province#Center_of_Trade "Province")
*   Return, [sell](/Diplomacy#Sell_province "Diplomacy"), or [buy](/Diplomacy#Charter_company "Diplomacy") provinces, or [grant them to your subjects](/Subject_nation#Subject_interactions "Subject nation"). However, you still can seize land from your vassals and marches.
*   [Release subjects](/Diplomacy#Release_subject "Diplomacy")
*   [Provoke revolts](/Rebellion#Provoke_revolt "Rebellion") in your country
*   [Sell ships](/Diplomacy#Sell_ships "Diplomacy")
*   [Threaten war](/Diplomacy#Threaten_war "Diplomacy")
*   [Offer vassalization](/Vassal#Offer_vassalization_.28diplomatic.29 "Vassal") to your allies that join the war
*   Establish [tributaries](/Subject_nation#Tributary "Subject nation"), or become a tributary yourself
*   [Annex vassals](/Vassal#Annexation "Vassal") which don't have [Scutage](/Subject_nation#Subject_interactions "Subject nation") enabled
*   [Create](/March#Creating_a_March "March") or [revoke](/March#Revoking_a_March "March") a march
*   [Intervene in war](/Great_power#Great_power_actions "Great power") as a Great Power

Following diplomatic actions are no more possible to use with countries that become your war enemies until war ends:

*   [Issue Embargo](/Trade#Embargo "Trade")
*   [Fabricate Claim](/Espionage#Fabricate_claim "Espionage")
*   [Send an Insult](/Diplomacy#Send_an_insult "Diplomacy")
*   [Send Warning](/Diplomacy#Send_warning "Diplomacy")
*   [Give subsidies](/Diplomacy#Give_subsidies "Diplomacy"); existing subsidies are automatically cancelled

Also, when your country is fighting offensive war AI will reject any alliance offers from you.

Sides in a war\[[edit](/index.php?title=Warfare&veaction=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Sides in a war") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Warfare&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Sides in a war")\]

![Ambox outdated info.png](https://central.paradoxwikis.com/images/thumb/6/65/Ambox_outdated_info.png/22px-Ambox_outdated_info.png)

Please help with verifying or updating this section. It was last verified for [version](/Europa_Universalis_4_Wiki:Versioning "Europa Universalis 4 Wiki:Versioning") 1.24.

A war consists of two opposing sides of one or more countries. A side may be made up of a [coalition](/Coalition "Coalition"), the emperor, [allies](/Allies "Allies") or the [defender of the Faith](/Defender_of_the_Faith "Defender of the Faith") who honour their treaties and/or [vassals](/Vassals "Vassals") and other subject countries.

### War leader\[[edit](/index.php?title=Warfare&veaction=edit&section=8 "Edit section: War leader") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Warfare&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: War leader")\]

The war leaders are denoted with a star in the war screen. The war leader on the attacking side is the country that declared the war, while on the defending side the leader is the country on which the war was declared (the target of the war goal). For each side in a war the leader is the country that may call in its allies and may negotiate peace on behalf of all their war allies, simultaneously ending the war for everybody. They may negotiate a separate peace with each of the hostile belligerents, except subject nations or coalition members. They may surrender territory of their war allies, but not their treasury.

When a war leader is annexed in a separate war, one of their allies will become the new war leader. The new war leader can call their own allies into the war if the war has not lasted long enough to close the window for calling allies to it. If the war leader is vassalized (by event or force) the new overlord will become the new war leader and can call their allies with the same caveat about calling allies to long wars.

### Military and port access\[[edit](/index.php?title=Warfare&veaction=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Military and port access") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Warfare&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Military and port access")\]

All nations on the same side in a war will have immediate military access to each other's lands. They may also dock at each other's ports, although their fleet supply range will not be extended. Furthermore, any nation in a war will be able to walk through all nations that have given access to any of the belligerents, even if those are not participating in the war.

### Joining a side\[[edit](/index.php?title=Warfare&veaction=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Joining a side") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Warfare&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Joining a side")\]

After a war has started, a country usually cannot join any of the sides unless called in later. There are three exceptions to this rule. The [enforce peace](/Diplomacy "Diplomacy") action allows for a country to force the attacking war leader to sign a white peace. If the attacker does not accept, the enforce will join the war on the defender's side. Another way to join a war after it has started is for a country to vassalize one of the countries involved in any of the sides. This will drag the new overlord to war as well. Finally, with [![Rights of Man.png](/images/thumb/5/50/Rights_of_Man.png/28px-Rights_of_Man.png)](/Rights_of_Man "Rights of Man") Rights of Man, a [great power](/Great_power "Great power") may intervene in a war involving at least three other great powers on the side that has fewer great powers.

A way of indirectly fighting in a war is for a country to rent out [condottieri](/Condottieri "Condottieri") to one of the countries involved.

Fighting a war\[[edit](/index.php?title=Warfare&veaction=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Fighting a war") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Warfare&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Fighting a war")\]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

_Main articles: [Land warfare](/Land_warfare "Land warfare"), [Naval warfare](/Naval_warfare "Naval warfare")_  

War may be fought on both the land and the sea. See the appropriate articles for more information.

War exhaustion\[[edit](/index.php?title=Warfare&veaction=edit&section=12 "Edit section: War exhaustion") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Warfare&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: War exhaustion")\]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

_Main article: [War exhaustion](/War_exhaustion "War exhaustion")_  

War exhaustion represents the will of a country's population to fight. High war exhaustion will sap the ability of a country's armies to fight and reinforce.

### Call for peace\[[edit](/index.php?title=Warfare&veaction=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Call for peace") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Warfare&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Call for peace")\]

If the warscore is substantial (66.6%+) and it has been at least 5 years since the war was declared, a country's abstracted population may _call for peace_. This modifier increases the nation's monthly [![War exhaustion.png](/images/8/8c/War_exhaustion.png)](/War_exhaustion "War exhaustion") war exhaustion, beginning at **+0.005** per month, and ticks up by another **+0.005** per month indefinitely. This means a call for peace will eventually start increasing a country's war exhaustion even if it has a monthly reduction, e.g. from being [Defender of the Faith](/Defender_of_the_Faith "Defender of the Faith"), having the 6th [Innovative idea](/Innovative_ideas "Innovative ideas"), or having the Kind-Hearted ruler trait. Only human players get call for peace.

Call for peace will also occur if the country fails to submit a peace offer within 3 months of an enemy [surrendering unconditionally](/Unconditional_surrender "Unconditional surrender"). In this case the ticking war exhaustion begins at **+0.05** per month and increases more quickly.

Warscore\[[edit](/index.php?title=Warfare&veaction=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Warscore") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Warfare&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Warscore")\]

![Ambox outdated info.png](https://central.paradoxwikis.com/images/thumb/6/65/Ambox_outdated_info.png/22px-Ambox_outdated_info.png)

Please help with verifying or updating this section. It was last verified for [version](/Europa_Universalis_4_Wiki:Versioning "Europa Universalis 4 Wiki:Versioning") 1.29.

Warscore is the means of measuring whether a war is going in the favor of the aggressor or the defender. It is a common metric used across a number of [Paradox Interactive](/Paradox_Interactive "Paradox Interactive") titles, including [Europa Universalis III](https://eu3.paradoxwikis.com/Europa_Universalis_3_Wiki "eu3:Europa Universalis 3 Wiki"), [EUIV](/EUIV "EUIV"), [Crusader Kings III](https://ck3.paradoxwikis.com/Crusader_Kings_III_Wiki "ck3:Crusader Kings III Wiki") and [Victoria II](https://vic2.paradoxwikis.com/Victoria_2_Wiki "v2:Victoria 2 Wiki").

The scale ranges from **+100%** (a complete victory for the side currently being viewed) to **−100%** (complete defeat for the side currently being viewed).

Warscore is measured using a number of different parameters:

*   Occupied [provinces](/Provinces "Provinces")
*   Battles won or lost, to a maximum of 40% in either direction.
*   Blockaded ports
*   Met war goals. A met war goal will cause war score to gradually tick up for whichever side has met it, to a maximum of 25%.

Note that both sides have symmetrical war goals. It is possible for no one to have met the goal; in particular, Show Superiority warscore won't tick if neither side has more than 10% warscore from battles, and a province goal won't tick if a third party (e.g. rebels) controls it. Hence, for provinces that are being colonized and yet are the war goal, rather seize them for yourself during the war, otherwise the enemy may destroy or abandon them and the target will then cease to exist – unable to provide a ticking war score.

### Occupation\[[edit](/index.php?title=Warfare&veaction=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Occupation") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Warfare&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Occupation")\]

Occupation is the term used to describe when a province has been successfully taken over by an enemy country. It requires the successful siege or assault of the local fortification. Upon occupation of a province, the owner of the province can no longer use the province for many purposes:

*   [Regiments](/Regiments "Regiments"), [ships](/Ships "Ships") and [buildings](/Buildings "Buildings") can no longer be built in the province, and any unit or improvement building that was underway (including cores and religious or cultural conversion) is immediately halted.
*   All province [income](/Income "Income") and [trade power](/Trade_power "Trade power") is no longer given to the owner; a portion of the province's production income and trade power is now given to the occupier.
*   The owner can no longer use the province for a fleet base; any ships currently in the port are forced out to the adjacent sea zone. The controller does have access to these ports.
*   The province does not count for the owner for calculating naval supply, colonial range and trade range. This is important, as one may have to unsiege certain provinces far away in order to take provinces in a peace deal (due to lack of colonial range). Force limits are unaffected.
*   The controller of the province can recruit mercenaries there.
*   Occupied forts project a [zone of control](/Zone_of_control "Zone of control") over unfortified land owned by countries that aren't allied to their occupier.

#### Transfer occupation\[[edit](/index.php?title=Warfare&veaction=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Transfer occupation") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Warfare&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Transfer occupation")\]

Countries can give up control over occupied provinces to their allies in war. (The [![Transfer occupation.png](/images/thumb/8/85/Transfer_occupation.png/24px-Transfer_occupation.png)](/File:Transfer_occupation.png) ‘transfer occupation’ button is located on the province screen.) This will make it possible to ensure that nations are rewarded for their participation in the war.

If you called an ally in with a promise of land, you may often find in the peace deal that they "do not want" the province in question - even if they highlighted it as a "province of interest" in the Diplomatic Feedback window. Hence, they will lose trust in you if you take any land or war reparations. However, there is a solution: before you peace out, make sure that ALL the land they highlighted as "province of interest" are under their control (hence you have transferred occupation to them), then even if you give them nothing, they will not lose trust in you (shown as a thumbs down warning in the peace menu, instead it will be neutral).

### Administrative efficiency\[[edit](/index.php?title=Warfare&veaction=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Administrative efficiency") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Warfare&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Administrative efficiency")\]

_Main article: [Overextension#Administrative efficiency](/Overextension#Administrative_efficiency "Overextension")_  

Administrative efficiency is a country wide bonus that is unlocked at administrative technology level 17 and increases at 23 and 27, up to a total of 30%. Additionally [![Absolutism.png](/images/thumb/c/c2/Absolutism.png/28px-Absolutism.png)](/Absolutism "Absolutism") [Absolutism](/Absolutism "Absolutism") provides additional administrative efficiency scaling with amount, up to 30% at 100. Administrative efficiency directly reduces core creation and diplomatic annexation costs, as well as the impact of province development on overextension and warscore cost, allowing for much larger territories to be conquered at once.

Sue for peace\[[edit](/index.php?title=Warfare&veaction=edit&section=18 "Edit section: Sue for peace") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Warfare&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: Sue for peace")\]

Peace interface, on the "Demand tribute" tab.

This option will open the peace negotiation screen where the country will negotiate their demands, the terms of their surrender or simply a white peace. The leader of each war alliance can make peace separately with each independent country on the other side (except any that joined as part of a coalition), in which case only individual warscore against that country and its subjects is taken into account (battles only count towards overall score). This can be essential to get the desired peace deal - the overall warscore may be lower than against a single participant, so the country can get more out of the war by picking off participants one by one.

### Unconditional surrender\[[edit](/index.php?title=Warfare&veaction=edit&section=19 "Edit section: Unconditional surrender") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Warfare&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: Unconditional surrender")\]

Please help improve this article or section by [**expanding it**](https://eu4.paradoxwikis.com/index.php?title=Warfare&action=edit) with: when exactly the AI surrenders unconditionally.

Upon offering unconditional surrender, all of the currently unoccupied provinces will fall under enemy control and the enemy will gain 100% warscore. Armies of the country that surrendered will become exiled and unable to fight in future battles until peace is signed. For the recipient of an unconditional surrender, it will be alerted of the enemy’s surrender and from then on will be able to enforce any possible peace up to 100% warscore cost. If the recipient country does not sign peace after a couple months, they will get call for peace giving them monthly war exhaustion which increases faster than normal. The peace will be automatically accepted by the nation that surrendered. In some circumstances the AI will unconditionally surrender.

### Peace terms\[[edit](/index.php?title=Warfare&veaction=edit&section=20 "Edit section: Peace terms") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Warfare&action=edit&section=20 "Edit section: Peace terms")\]

Each term in a peace offer has an associated cost in warscore, Prestige gain/loss for both sides and possible aggressive expansion for anyone making sizable, selfish demands. **An appropriate [casus belli](/Casus_belli "Casus belli") may modify any or all of these values**, and is required to enable certain terms. A country making peace separately may only accept terms relating to itself and its subjects, not other participants in the war.

0.6 per development[\[Note 2\]](#cite_note-AE-2)

The selected province of the country on the losing side is annexed by its current occupier, or by the country making peace if not occupied. If it is occupied, the occupier must be one of the parties to the peace. If a CB with the "Take province"(e.g. conquest or reconquest) or "Take colony" wargoal is used, the warscore cost for the wargoal is lowered by ⅓ if it is occupied(this does not apply to CBs with the "Take capital" wargoal). In a coalition war, members of the coalition may only take their own cores. AI won't accept giving away unoccupied forts, or unfortified provinces that are near forts if none of them are occupied.

Revoke core

Half province cost

0.1 per development[\[Note 1\]](#cite_note-prestige_reduced-1)

[](/File:Distribute_spoils.png "Enlarge")

Shows distribute spoils in game.

Spoils of war are distributed between its participants with prestige and money going to the belligerents of the war based on their war contribution rather than only to the war leader. For example, if Spain and France fight in a war against Great Britain and France gets 70% war contribution and Spain 30% then the prestige and money will be divided so that 70% goes to France and 30% goes to Spain.

### Truce\[[edit](/index.php?title=Warfare&veaction=edit&section=23 "Edit section: Truce") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Warfare&action=edit&section=23 "Edit section: Truce")\]

Once a peace deal is accepted, it results in a state of truce between every country on the offering side and every country on the accepting side. Specifically, when a country other than a war leader accepts peace, or offers a peace deal the other side's war leader accepted, it enters truce with every enemy country still in the war, but its war allies are not affected.

The duration of the truce depends on the amount of warscore that was used to demand or offer tribute in the peace deal. The formula is ![{\displaystyle {\text{peace duration in years}}=5\,+\,0.1\,\times \,{\text{percentage of war score the peace deal is worth}}}](https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/png/271a5612267176db8efd33ce840724c9db6a3905)

so a white peace will result in a 5-year truce, whereas a peace deal at 100% war score will produce a 15-year truce. When a country is released in a peace deal, it starts with a 5-year truce with both the releasing nation and the opposing war leader.

A country cannot embargo or join a coalition against a country it has a truce with, though ongoing embargoes are unaffected. A country with a truce also cannot be designated co-belligerent. It can still declare or join a war with the country with a truce, but with the following consequences if it is an offensive war:

These stack with the penalties for other reasons. So attacking in breach of a truce without a CB and without full diplomacy results in **−7** stability, **+7** war exhaustion and **−70** aggressive expansion. As seen above, breaking a truce has very negative effects when declaring war or joining an offensive war against a country with whom a truce exists. The AI has **−1000** reasons to join an offensive war if they have a truce with the defender and appears to never declare war, join as an ally in an offensive war, or call an ally into an offensive war if that would break a truce. Joining defensive wars, or where the country with a truce is a secondary participant, does not give a penalty.

### Revanchism\[[edit](/index.php?title=Warfare&veaction=edit&section=24 "Edit section: Revanchism") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Warfare&action=edit&section=24 "Edit section: Revanchism")\]

[](/File:Revanchism.png "Enlarge")

An example of revanchism.

Revanchism is a mechanic that helps prevent a "death spiral" after losing a war where a country would go bankrupt, lose manpower and have huge revolts, followed by other countries declaring war as well, leading the nation to ruin. Revanchism is gained from losing provinces in a war and scales in direct correspondence to the war score taken in a peace deal, with a max of **100%** revanchism at **100%** warscore. Revanchism decreases at a rate of 10% per year. Releasing nations and returning cores does not grant revanchism.

With maximum revanchism of **100%** (from having **100%** warscore worth taken in a peace deal), a country gets the following modifiers: [\[3\]](#cite_note-8)

### Full Annexation\[[edit](/index.php?title=Warfare&veaction=edit&section=25 "Edit section: Full Annexation") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Warfare&action=edit&section=25 "Edit section: Full Annexation")\]

Upon annexing all of the provinces of a participant of a war in a peace deal, all [subject nations](/Subject_nations "Subject nations") of the annexed nation except personal unions become subjects of the annexing nation. This costs nothing above the cost of annexing the overlord. [Junior partners](/Junior_partner "Junior partner") of the annexed nation become independent instead.

Human players are largely free to accept or refuse any peace deal. However, as with other diplomatic actions, the AI will accept a peace deal if and only if it has more **positive** than **negative** reasons to do so.

### Warscore\[[edit](/index.php?title=Warfare&veaction=edit&section=27 "Edit section: Warscore") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Warfare&action=edit&section=27 "Edit section: Warscore")\]

The warscore is of primary importance. Each point of warscore will give **+1** reason for the AI to accept a peace deal, whereas each warscore cost of the peace terms will give **−1** reason for the AI to accept a peace deal. The AI will refuse all demands if _individual_ warscore is less than 10.

Demands exceeding warscore will give additional negative reasons for the AI to accept the peace deal, up to **−100** at 99% warscore and lower. Demands exceeding 100% warscore will give **−1000** reasons (unreasonable demands, not to be confused with Unjustified demand). Individual demands that would cost over 100% warscore, such as vassalizing a country that is too large, can't be selected.

If one side of the war has 100% warscore, the country is forced to accept any peace offer of 100% or less warscore. This also applies to losing human players. Note that 100% warscore only happens when one side fully occupies the other and is itself completely unoccupied. Otherwise, warscore is capped at 99%.

Regardless of warscore, the AI may refuse peace deals that contain terms that they do not desire; for example, provinces they will be unable to [core](/Core "Core"). Such offers cannot be submitted (the "Send Demand" button is greyed out). The only exception is stated above, where the AI is forced to take a province they are unable to [core](/Core "Core") if the other side has more than 100% warscore.

If you called an ally in with a promise of land, you may often find in the peace deal that they "do not want" the province in question - even if they highlighted it as a "province of interest" in the Diplomatic Feedback window. Hence, they will lose trust in you if you take any land or war reparations. However, there is a solution: before you peace out, make sure that ALL the land they highlighted as "province of interest" are under their control (hence you have transferred occupation to them), then even if you give them nothing, they will not lose trust in you (shown as a thumbs down warning in the peace menu, instead it will be neutral).

#### Province cost\[[edit](/index.php?title=Warfare&veaction=edit&section=28 "Edit section: Province cost") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Warfare&action=edit&section=28 "Edit section: Province cost")\]

Each province that changes control in a peace deal requires a corresponding [![Province war score cost.png](/images/thumb/9/9c/Province_war_score_cost.png/28px-Province_war_score_cost.png)](/Province_war_score_cost "Province war score cost") warscore cost. The factors that influence each province's warscore cost are:

Base

**5** per province.

Development

**1** per development, cap at 30

Trade power

**0.2** per base trade power (before modifiers applied)

Capital

**0.2** × (5 + development) if the province is a capital

Local autonomy

**−0.33%** per percentage point

Size of nation

**−1%** per 15 development of nation (owner)

Administrative efficiency

**−1%** per point of the annexing country's [![Administrative efficiency.png](/images/thumb/6/6e/Administrative_efficiency.png/28px-Administrative_efficiency.png)](/Administrative_efficiency "Administrative efficiency") [administrative efficiency](/Administrative_efficiency "Administrative efficiency")

The local autonomy, size of nation and administration efficiency factors are applied multiplicatively.

### War enthusiasm\[[edit](/index.php?title=Warfare&veaction=edit&section=29 "Edit section: War enthusiasm") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Warfare&action=edit&section=29 "Edit section: War enthusiasm")\]

[![Ambox outdated content.png](https://central.paradoxwikis.com/images/5/58/Ambox_outdated_content.png)](/File:Ambox_outdated_content.png)

**Warfare** may need to be updated. [**Please update this article**](https://eu4.paradoxwikis.com/index.php?title=Warfare&action=edit) to reflect recent events or newly available information, and remove this template when finished. Please [see the talk page](/Talk:Warfare "Talk:Warfare") for more information.

Other factors also give reasons for the AI to accept or refuse a peace deal. These are summed up as war enthusiasm in the war screen. Positive War Enthusiasm is applied as negative reasons for that country to accept peace deals.

*   Length of war: **+45** at start of war, decays by **−0.75** at the start of each calendar month thereafter (5 years until it becomes negative).
*   [Casus belli](/Casus_belli "Casus belli") "Religious League" and "Crush the Revolution": **+50**
*   [Casus belli](/Casus_belli "Casus belli") "Coalition": **+30** for attackers
*   Relative strength of alliances: **−20** to **+20** for war leader only
*   Ally in war: **+10** for allies called in by war leader
*   Military strength: **−20** to **+20**, depending on proportion of manpower and land force limit that is filled, as well as battles lost or won
*   Recent gains: **−20** to **+20** for war leader only.
*   Hold their own [capital](/Capital "Capital"): **+5**
*   War exhaustion: **−1** per point of war exhaustion
*   Occupied and besieged provinces: scales linearly with base tax of provinces affected, up to **−20** for full besiegement, and **−40** for full occupation. The formula is roughly![{\displaystyle {\text{modifier}}=-{\frac {(20\cdot {\text{base tax under siege}})+(40\cdot {\text{base tax occupied}})}{\text{total base tax}}}}](https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/png/ae1d68daf3cfd39ddc80eb4556b1e00910b83f92)Colonies and distant overseas provinces are ignored in this calculation.
*   Revolts in country: depends on the size of all rebellions relative to current military strength. The formula is![{\displaystyle {\text{modifier}}={\frac {-20\cdot {\text{number of rebel regiments on owned territory}}}{\text{number of national regiments}}}}](https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/png/ecf3960712337b338eb89fa3c225713695a0973e)with the final number rounded to the nearest integer and capped at **−20**.

If war enthusiasm is between 0 and 20 it's classified as medium; below 0 is low and above 20 is high.

### Stability hit\[[edit](/index.php?title=Warfare&veaction=edit&section=30 "Edit section: Stability hit") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Warfare&action=edit&section=30 "Edit section: Stability hit")\]

If a player refuses a peace offer that entails demands for less than 50% of the current warscore, and the warscore itself is higher than 50%, the declining party takes a **−1** hit to [![Stability.png](/images/a/ae/Stability.png)](/Stability "Stability") [stability](/Stability "Stability"). When a player is already at **−3** [![Stability.png](/images/a/ae/Stability.png)](/Stability "Stability") stability, any qualifying offer is automatically accepted on behalf of the player. There is a [![Diplomatic power.png](/images/d/da/Diplomatic_power.png)](/Diplomatic_power "Diplomatic power") icon displayed above the 'send peace request' button which shows that if the player refuses this peace, they will lose stability

This mechanic aims to prevent players from unreasonably dragging out lost wars to harm their opponents (by deliberately causing [war exhaustion](/War_exhaustion "War exhaustion") to rise or [rebels](/Rebels "Rebels") to spawn).

The AI has other rules for accepting peace deals and does _not_ get a stability hit.
