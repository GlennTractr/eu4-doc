The launcher's DLC management section.

**Downloadable content (DLC)** is content built by [Paradox Development Studio](/Paradox_Development_Studio "Paradox Development Studio") (PDS) as an extension or add-on to [Europa Universalis IV](/Europa_Universalis_IV "Europa Universalis IV"). They are modular in nature,[\[1\]](#cite_note-1) which means that a player can choose to play with or without a given DLC by checking them out at the launch menu. An expansion DLC is normally accompanied by a free [patch](/Patches "Patches") that gives players most of the new content as not to hinder the playability of the game. As such, most DLCs are seen as optional content for players who wish to have a better gaming experience in exchange for some monetary support.

[Multiplayer](/Multiplayer "Multiplayer") games also benefit from this compatibility, that is to say, if the host has a gameplay DLC (expansions and immersion packs) the player does not, the game acts as if the player has it.
