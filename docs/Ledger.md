Categories of the ledger

The **ledger** is several pages of statistical information that can be found in the bottom right corner of the screen or can be activated with the shortcut 'L'. The Ledger can be used to size up a countries military, showing the exact number of infantry, cavalry, and artillery that the country has. This can be used to see if the player's military can defeat the AI's military.
