Revisit some of the most powerful and popular nations in **Domination**, an expansion pack for Europa Universalis IV. Centered on the great empires of the early modern world, Domination offers new mission trees, new government reforms, new estate management and new events for several of the major powers in the game. These popular starting nations are now given new life and new balance, with greater historical depth, more promising rewards and branching mission trees so player choices can have a dramatic impact on the course of history.
