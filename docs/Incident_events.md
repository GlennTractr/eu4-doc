The Burgundian Inheritance [\[1\]](#cite_note-1)\[[edit](/index.php?title=Incident_events&veaction=edit&section=1 "Edit section: The Burgundian Inheritance [1]") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Incident_events&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: The Burgundian Inheritance [1]")\]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Burgundian Inheritance happens through multiple effects[\[2\]](#cite_note-2) and events. The starting heir of Burgundy Charles I de Bourgogne has the flag is\_charles\_of\_burg\_flag. When a monarch with that flag ascends to the throne of [![Flag of Burgundy](/images/thumb/b/b0/Burgundy.png/20px-Burgundy.png)](/Burgundy "Burgundy") [Burgundy](/Burgundy "Burgundy"), the flag is removed and the country gets the hidden modifier _“Burgundian Succession Crisis”_ with the following effects:

*   [![Chance of new heir.png](/images/thumb/7/72/Chance_of_new_heir.png/24px-Chance_of_new_heir.png)](/Chance_of_new_heir "Chance of new heir") **−95%** heir chance.
*   [![Chance of new heir.png](/images/thumb/7/72/Chance_of_new_heir.png/24px-Chance_of_new_heir.png)](/Chance_of_new_heir "Chance of new heir") **−1** Monthly heir claim increase
*   disables the [introduce heir](/Introduce_heir "Introduce heir") action

The modifier _“Burgundian Succession Crisis”_ is one of the requirements for the event [Marie of Burgundy](#incidents_bur_inheritance.0). If the option to make Marie an heir is chosen, the heir flag mary\_is\_heir is set.

The next time that the ruler dies, the modifier _“Burgundian Succession Crisis”_ gets removed as long as the country is still Burgundy. If all of the following conditions are fulfilled as well:

*   is [![Flag of Burgundy](/images/thumb/b/b0/Burgundy.png/20px-Burgundy.png)](/Burgundy "Burgundy") [Burgundy](/Burgundy "Burgundy")
*   is _not_ emperor of the [HRE](/HRE "HRE")
*   one of the following must be true:
    *   is in a [regency](/Regency "Regency")
    *   has less than [![Legitimacy.png](/images/thumb/2/25/Legitimacy.png/24px-Legitimacy.png)](/Legitimacy "Legitimacy") 40 legitimacy
    *   ruler or heir flag mary\_is\_heir is set

Then:

*   If ruler or heir flag mary\_is\_heir is set:
    *   gain [![Legitimacy.png](/images/2/25/Legitimacy.png)](/Legitimacy "Legitimacy") **10** legitimacy
*   else:
    *   gets a new 21 year old female [ruler](/Ruler "Ruler") named ‘Marie de Bourgogne’ with 50 [legitimacy](/Legitimacy "Legitimacy") and the skills [![Administrative power.png](/images/e/ef/Administrative_power.png)](/Administrative_power "Administrative power") 4/ [![Diplomatic power.png](/images/d/da/Diplomatic_power.png)](/Diplomatic_power "Diplomatic power") 5/ [![Military power.png](/images/9/98/Military_power.png)](/Military_power "Military power") 3.
    *   set the ruler flag mary\_is\_heir
*   the event [The Burgundian Succession](#incidents_bur_inheritance.1) happens

_It seems the line of \[Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName\] has grown rotten and withered with \[Root.Monarch.GetName\]’s final seed. \[Root.Monarch.GetName\] \[Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName\] has been incapable of producing an heir in all of his years as the last remaining male of the \[Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName\] line.  
  
However, the \[Root.Monarch.GetTitle\] did produce a talented and beautiful Princess by the name of Marie. \[Root.Monarch.GetHerHisCap\] father Philippe \[Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName\] famously despised Marie and insisted that no woman should sit the throne of Burgundy, but \[Root.Monarch.GetName\] is not his father and times are growing desperate. Should \[Root.Monarch.GetName\] die without producing an heir, Marie will become \[Root.Monarch.GetHerHis\] de facto successor either way, but if \[Root.Monarch.GetName\] forsook the pursuit of a male heir and favored Marie as the rightful heir to Burgundy, her claim would be strengthened and we may be able to negotiate our way through this succession crisis with minimal strife.  
  
Female heirs are seen as quite the prize for ambitious men, and Marie's succession may lead to Burgundy falling under a union with a foreign power._

### ![Msg event.png](/images/4/4e/Msg_event.png)The Burgundian Succession

_It is as we had always feared, the Duke of Burgundy has passed from this life to the heavens without producing an eligible male heir. With the Duke’s untimely demise, \[Root.Monarch.GetName\] \[Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName\] has ascended as the \[Root.Monarch.GetTitle\] of Burgundy. However, with \[Root.Monarch.GetHerHis\] claim relatively weak in the eyes of many noble lords and ladies, Burgundy is seen as ripe for the taking by the ambitious King of France and Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire.  
  
\[Root.Monarch.GetName\] is a brave and intelligent young woman but if Burgundy is to survive this crisis without falling into conflict with one of the major powers, then \[Root.Monarch.GetName\] must marry into a prestigious royal family to seek their support and protection. Of course, \[Root.Monarch.GetName\] will be wed in a traditional patrilineal marriage so Burgundy will essentially be subject to a foreign nation, but in this time of great chaos, what choice do we have?_

_With the death of the Duke of \[BUR.GetName\], the reforms that he passed which led to the close integration of the Lowlands with the rest of the \[Root.GetAdjective\] \[Root.GovernmentName\] have come back to haunt us. The \[Emperor.Monarch.GetTitle\] has sent an envoy, demanding that the Lowlands be separated from the \[BUR.GovernmentName\] of \[BUR.GetName\] and returned to their Princehood status within the Holy Roman Empire.  
  
However, \[Root.Monarch.GetName\] is a cunning and wise \[Root.Monarch.GetTitle\], and has proposed to revoke the reforms of the previous ruler of \[BUR.GetName\] and introduce a Great Privilege. The Privilege would enforce that all cities in the Lowlands recognise \[BUR.GetName\] as their rightful \[BUR.Monarch.GetTitle\] but also remain loyal to the \[Emperor.Monarch.GetTitle\] of the Holy Roman Empire. Our scheme could of course backfire and the \[Emperor.Monarch.GetTitle\] could use this as a provocation for war, but there is also a chance that \[Emperor.Monarch.GetTitle\] \[Emperor.Monarch.GetName\] will be satisfied for now..._

A sweet and kind-hearted girl, Marie will be sorely missed in the \[burgundy\_senior\_partner.GetAdjective\] court, but now that she has passed, it would seem that we are to be inherited by \[burgundy\_senior\_partner.GetName\]. Many nobles of the realm are already bending the knee to the \[burgundy\_senior\_partner.Monarch.GetTitle\] of \[burgundy\_senior\_partner.GetName\], but many others are beginning to flock around a distant cousin to Marie and one of few surviving members of the Burgundian royal family. Should we submit, our \[Root.GovernmentName\] will be no more and we shall be annexed into the \[burgundy\_senior\_partner.GetAdjective\] \[burgundy\_senior\_partner.GovernmentName\]. Should we recognise the weak claim of the Burgundian pretender, we shall no-doubt enter a state of war with \[burgundy\_senior\_partner.GetName\]._

_Sad news reaches \[Root.Capital.GetName\] today as we learn that our beloved Marie, Duchess of Burgundy, has passed from this life into the next. A sweet and kind-hearted girl, and a loving wife to the \[Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName\] Prince, Marie will be sorely missed in the \[burgundy\_senior\_partner.GetAdjective\] court. Marie was a passionate horse-rider and accompanied her husband on his routine hunts, but her kind heart and passion for riding could not save her when her five-hundred-kilogram horse fell atop her and shattered her spine.  
  
To our surprise, the lords and ladies of Burgundy have not immediately begun bending the knee to our \[Root.Monarch.GetTitle\], but have instead recognised a distant cousin of Marie’s as their rightful ruler. This is ridiculous, the law makes it clear that a \[Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName\] must succeed upon Marie’s death. It appears the mad nobles of Burgundy only recognise the language of violence and we shall have to enforce our lawful claim with blood._

_\[Root.GetName\] has narrowly avoided a disastrous succession crisis, with \[Root.Monarch.GetTitle\] \[Root.Monarch.GetName\] finally emerging as our undisputed ruler. But the laws of succession remain unchanged and could leave us vulnerable to another crisis in the future. The \[Root.Monarch.GetTitle\] considers whether to institute legal reforms that would give men and women equal rights to the inheritance of titles, eliminating the desperate need for monarchs to have male heirs or risk the dissolution of their realms. Alternatively, we may consider the crisis to be averted and focus instead on strengthening the traditional order that has elevated \[Root.GetName\] to the precipice of greatness._

_Our state originally owed its existence to the royal family of Burgundy who broke away from the French Kingdom in an attempt to press our rightful claim on the Throne of all Franks. We have thus far not opted to press our claim on the Kingdom of France and as such, our claim has long since grown cold. The notion of a truly independent Burgundy existing in perpetuity is laughable to many foreign nobles, and our \[Root.Monarch.GetTitle\] has been advised by the royal council to seek entrance into the Holy Roman Empire and bend the knee to \[Emperor.Monarch.GetTitle\] \[Emperor.Monarch.GetName\] \[Emperor.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName\] as an Imperial Prince.

_The \[BUR.Monarch.GetTitle\] of \[BUR.GetName\] wishes to join the Holy Roman Empire. While it may seem like a straightforward decision, there are a number of dangers that a Burgundian Prince would represent to the Empire. It would become difficult for us to resist Burgundy’s continued advances into Imperial territory, and the Electors may begin to feel that the Burgundians would be a suitable candidate for Emperorship. However, integrating Burgundy into the Empire would completely dissipate the tensions between the Empire and Burgundy, and present the unique opportunity to expand Imperial influence into France._
