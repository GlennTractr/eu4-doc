All wiki pages are to be assessed based on the following guidelines:

Class

Criteria

Reader's experience

Editing suggestions

Example

[FA](/Category:FA-class_articles "Category:FA-class articles")

The article has attained featured article status by passing an official review.

Professional, outstanding, and thorough; a definitive source for encyclopedic information.

No further content additions should be necessary unless new information becomes available; further improvements to the prose quality are often possible.

[Buildings](/Buildings "Buildings")

A

The article is well organized and essentially complete.

Very useful to readers. A fairly complete treatment of the subject. A non-expert would typically find nothing wanting.

Expert knowledge may be needed to tweak the article, and style problems may need solving.

[Land warfare](http://eu4wiki.com/index.php?title=Land_warfare&oldid=16813)

[B](/Category:B-class_articles "Category:B-class articles")

The article is mostly complete and without major problems, but requires some further work to reach good article standards.

Readers are not left wanting, although the content may not be complete enough to satisfy a serious player or modder.

A few aspects of content and style need to be addressed. Expert knowledge may be needed. The article checked for general compliance with the [style guidelines](/Europa_Universalis_4_Wiki:Style "Europa Universalis 4 Wiki:Style").

[England](http://eu4wiki.com/index.php?title=England&oldid=15467)

[C](/Category:C-class_articles "Category:C-class articles")

The article is substantial, but is still missing important content or contains much irrelevant material.

Useful to a casual reader, but would not provide a complete picture for even a moderately detailed study.

Considerable editing is needed to close gaps in content and solve cleanup problems.

[Ruler](http://www.eu4wiki.com/index.php?title=Ruler&oldid=25236)

[Start](/Category:Start-class_articles "Category:Start-class articles")

An article that is developing, but which is quite incomplete.

Provides some meaningful content, but most readers will need more.

The article needs substantial improvement in content and organisation.

[Ironman](http://eu4wiki.com/index.php?title=Ironman&oldid=11407)

[Stub](/Category:Stub-class_articles "Category:Stub-class articles")

A very basic description of the topic.

Provides very little meaningful content; may be little more than a dictionary definition.

Any editing or additional material can be helpful. The provision of meaningful content should be a priority.

[Patches](http://eu4wiki.com/index.php?title=Patches&oldid=12064)

[Disambig](/Category:Disambig-class_articles "Category:Disambig-class articles")

Any [disambiguation](/Category:Disambiguation "Category:Disambiguation") page falls under this class.

The page serves to distinguish multiple articles that share the same (or similar) title.

Additions should be made as new articles of that name are created.

[America (disambiguation)](/America_(disambiguation) "America (disambiguation)")

[List](/Category:List-class_articles "Category:List-class articles")

Meets the criteria of a stand-alone list, which is an article that contains primarily a list.

There is no set format for a list, but its organization should be logical and useful to the reader.

Lists should be appropriately named and organized.

[List of provinces](/List_of_provinces "List of provinces")

[Mod](/Category:Mod-class_articles "Category:Mod-class articles")

The article is either a [mod](/Mods "Mods") page or a mod subpage.

The page should detail the modification in question or a subsection of it. The wiki team take no responsibility for the quality of mod class articles.

Maintenance of the page is left to the modification team, however inactive mods and unmaintained pages may be removed at the discretion of the wiki team.

[MEIOU and Taxes](/MEIOU_and_Taxes "MEIOU and Taxes")

All articles that have been rated as A-class on the wiki [quality scale](/Europa_Universalis_4_Wiki:Style#Assessment "Europa Universalis 4 Wiki:Style") are assigned to this category.
