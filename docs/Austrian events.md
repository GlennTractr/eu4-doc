_A temporary doctrinal agreement was proclaimed in May 1548 between German Catholics and Protestants and became imperial law on June 30, 1548. It was prepared and accepted at the insistence of the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, who hoped to establish temporary religious unity in Germany until differences could be worked out in a general council of the Catholic Church. The Augsburg Interim primarily reflected a Catholic viewpoint. It did, however, allow clerical marriage and communion in both kinds (bread and wine) for the laity. Several Protestant electors objected to the Catholic emphasis of the Augsburg Interim and refused to abide by it. Charles attempted to force its acceptance, an action that led the Protestants to adopt the Leipzig Interim, which upheld Protestant doctrines, at a subsequent Diet. Neither interim was fully accepted so a German religious settlement was not brought about until the Peace of Augsburg in 1555._

_The 1620s were characterized by long and cold winters, late springs and cold and wet summers, leading to crop-failure and sharp increases in grain prices. Into this atmosphere of enhanced tension broke a climatic event of unusual severity. In 1626, during the last week of May, in the middle of the vegetation period, winter returned. The temperature fell so that lakes and rivers froze and trees shed their leaves. The unexpected return of winter caused panic and anxiety among the peasants who could not remember ever experiencing such destruction of their fields. This event, combined with the brutal persecution of Protestants, led the mainly Protestant peasants of Upper Austria, pledged to Bavaria, to revolt. The peasants were defeated after heavy fighting, and in 1628 the country passed into the hands of the emperor again._

_As struggles came and went the ruling family of Hungary, the Habsburgs, had established the following pattern in treating their nobility. During times of foreign war, nobles were granted rights which the crown then tried to recall as soon as peace came. This, naturally, often triggered revolts. Following this pattern, taxes and military drafts were imposed upon the nobles after Hungary's decisive victory over the Turks in 1699. But, when Austria went to war with France in 1703, the nobles revolted once again, and forced the Emperor Charles V to restore the old system of noble privileges, in the Peace of Szatmar of 1711._

_Wenzel Anton, Earl and then Prince of Rittberg-Kaunitz (1711-1794) was a noble from Bohemia. Impregnated of the culture of the Enlightenment, a devoted civil servant, he always had the full confidence and support from Empress Maria-Theresa. After a diplomatic career, he became Chancellor of Austria in 1753, till 1792. A partisan of alliance shifts, he worked out the closer ties with France that led to the Seven Years War, but also managed to renew with Frederick II of Prussia in time to be part of the first partition of Poland._

_Metternich began his state career in 1797 as representative of the Westphalian College of counts at the Congress of Rastatt, but in less than a decade, he had managed to become ambassador of Saxony and Preussen as well as the Austrian representative in France. His career primed in 1809 when he was assigned the post as minister of Austrian foreign affairs. Until 1813 Metternich will pursue a policy of acquiescence to French supremacy. A policy which ends with the creation of the Quadruple Alliance, the war against France, and the allied victory the very same year. The following 35 years have been called the Age of Metternich for during this time he was the chief arbiter of Europe. The Metternich system depended upon political and religious censorship, espionage, and the suppression of revolutionary and nationalist movements. This system holds part of the blame for the revolutions of 1848._

_Religious antagonism played an important part when war between the empire and the Turks broke out again in 1591. In the so-called Long War, imperial troops entered Transylvania, and their commander, George Basta, behaved there and in northern Hungary with such insane cruelty toward the Hungarian Protestants that a Transylvanian general, István Bocskay, formerly a Habsburg supporter, revolted. His army of wild hajduks drove out Basta, and in June 1606 Bocskay concluded with Rudolf the Peace of Vienna, which left him prince of an enlarged Transylvania and also guaranteed the rights of the Protestants of Royal Hungary._

These reforms consisted of nothing less than the abolition of hereditary and ecclesiastic privileges as well as the creation of a civil service based on merit and loyalty rather than birth._

_Maria Theresa determined from the outset of her reign that the Habsburg monarchy would never again be perceived as too weak to defend itself. Consequently, even while the war was under way she had been studying reforms, and when it ended she immediately began implementing them. First and foremost was the reform of the army. Maria Theresa realized, however, that no military reform would be effective without financial reform and in this area, advised by the brilliant Friedrich Wilhelm, Count von Haugwitz, she achieved her perhaps greatest accomplishments. Following the military and financial reforms other changes came, generally in administrative matters. Although these reforms were subjected too many modifications and changes throughout Maria Theresa's reign and after, the result was a government far more centralized than it had ever been before._

_Joseph II was a controversial ruler. He began his reign with liberal reforms like the Edict of Toleration, which gave Lutherans, Calvinists, and Orthodox near equality with Roman Catholics. He also abolished serfdom and (temporarily) eased up on official censorship. However, Joseph was also an extreme centralist. In 1784 he informed the Hungarian government that its official language, Latin, was really not effective for modern government and would be changed to German. To add to their horror, Joseph refused to submit to a coronation in Hungary lest he have to swear to uphold laws that he did not wish to, and then he had the sacred crown of the kingdom moved to Vienna.

_The Italian Wars were a series of wars between 1494 and 1559 that involved most Italian city-states, the Papal State and drew in major powers like France, Spain and the Holy Roman Empire. The earlier War of Lombardy against the Republic of Venice had left the Duchy of Milan seeking an ally and turned to Charles VIII of France for help. Using the House of Valois' old claim to the throne of Naples as a pretext when Ferdinand I of Naples died, Charles invaded the peninsula in 1494. With his army followed a large and mobile siege train that battered down the medieval city walls in a matter of days - triggering the reforms that led to the fortification style called 'Trace Italienne.' Despite tactical victories in the field, Charles became cut off from France and was forced to return home in 1498. The conflict over Italy was, however, far from over and the wars between Spain and France would go on for another 61 years._

_The Italian Wars were a series of wars between 1494 and 1559 that involved most Italian city-states, the Papal State and drew in major powers like France, Spain and the Holy Roman Empire. The earlier War of Lombardy against the Republic of Venice had left the Duchy of Milan seeking an ally and turned to Charles VIII of France for help. Using the House of Valois' old claim to the throne of Naples as a pretext when Ferdinand I of Naples died, Charles invaded the peninsula in 1494. Despite tactical victories in the field, Charles became cut off from France and was forced to return home in 1498. The conflict over Italy was, however, far from over and the wars between Spain and France would go on for another 61 years.  
  
\[From.GetName\] has now claimed all our provinces in Italy!_

_The largest wave of germans immigrating into Hungary occurred due to a deliberate settlement policy of the Habsburg government, after the Ottoman Empire has been forced away from Hungarian lands. Between 1711 and 1780, German-speaking settlers from Southern Germany, Austria, and Saxony immigrated to the Southwest of Hungary. This influx of immigrants helped to bring economic recovery and cultural distinction to these regions. At the end of the 18th century, the Kingdom of Hungary contained over one million German-speaking residents. During this time, a flourishing German-speaking culture could be found in the kingdom, with German-language literary works, newspapers, and magazines being produced._

The output has, however, been sufficient to cover the need of the region itself and among the population skilled weavers can be found. Foreign investors now consider this area as ripe for investment and North German merchants believe that the region could grow even richer if textile production was promoted more through a putting-out system._

Today a number of Dutch and English captains as well as Flemish merchants approached $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ and asked for a royal charter of their own. They claim to have the necessary expertise and starting capital themselves already and only ask for a Royal Charter so that they may compete with the other India Companies without being considered renegades or pirates. In return the company shall be based in the Austrian Netherlands and will allow us to take part in the Indian and Chinese riches._

_While still young the Ostende Company has done better than anyone in $CAPITAL\_CITY$ expected. The Company may lack the financial muscle of the older India Companies but the Ostende Company has still managed to do very well in some areas. Last year half of the tea exported to Europe was transported by Ostende ships.  
The success of the Company has, however, not made us any friends. The English and Dutch both claim that the Ostende Company is a sham set up by their disloyal subjects masquerading as Austrian/Flemish sailors. They show little understanding for our desire to get in on the India trade and as long as the Company operates they will hold it against us. In $CAPITAL\_CITY$ some sympathize with them, our country has never been a naval power and this all seems like an unnecessary adventure to them._
