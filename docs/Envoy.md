**Envoys** are a special type of agent which help a country undertake certain actions. Each country has a limited number of each envoy, depending on its [technology](/Technology "Technology") level, [idea groups](/Idea_groups "Idea groups") and other factors. It takes a certain amount of time for an envoy to complete assigned missions. There are four types of envoys: [![Diplomat.png](/images/thumb/e/ee/Diplomat.png/28px-Diplomat.png)](/Diplomat "Diplomat") diplomats, [![Missionaries.png](/images/thumb/a/ad/Missionaries.png/28px-Missionaries.png)](/Missionary "Missionary") missionaries, [![Merchants.png](/images/thumb/2/24/Merchants.png/28px-Merchants.png)](/Merchant "Merchant") merchants, and [![Colonists.png](/images/thumb/3/34/Colonists.png/28px-Colonists.png)](/Colonist "Colonist") colonists.

Diplomats are used to send in Diplomatic Actions to send Diplomatic Offers to other nations. Once they have delivered the offer, they will have to return home before you can give them a new order.

_See also: [Diplomacy#Diplomats](/Diplomacy#Diplomats "Diplomacy")_  

Diplomats are able to execute both [official](/Diplomacy#Traditional_Diplomatic_Actions "Diplomacy") and [covert](/Diplomacy#Covert_Diplomatic_Actions "Diplomacy") diplomatic actions. The default number of available diplomats is two.

Missionaries are envoys used to convert the religion in provinces. When a province is not the same religion as your state religion, you can send a Missionary to begin converting the province. When he is finished, he will return home and be ready for another order.

_See also: [Religion#Conversion](/Religion#Conversion "Religion")_  

Missionaries are [religious](/Religion "Religion") envoys that can be tasked (for a monetary cost) with converting the religion of a province a country owns to that of the country's official religion. The default number of available missionaries is one.

Merchants can be used to perform one of two actions in a Trade Node. They can either Collect from Trade or Transfer Trade Value. A Merchant that is performing Collect from Trade will increase the income generated from that Trade Node, while a Merchant performing Transfer Trade Value will be able to steer Trade Value.

_See also: [Trade#Merchants](/Trade#Merchants "Trade")_  

Merchants manipulate the flow of ducats at [trade nodes](/Trade_nodes "Trade nodes"), where they can either _transfer_ trade on to the next node in the route, or _collect_ trade for their country's treasury in trade nodes other than their [capital](/Capital "Capital")'s. If collecting in their capital, they will increase the ducats collected by **+10%**, but are not needed to collect trade in the capital. The default number of available merchants is two.

**Gaining merchants**

*   **+1** from the _East India Merchant Company_ [event](/Event "Event")
*   **+1** merchant for each [colonial nation](/Colonial_nation "Colonial nation") they control with more than 10 provinces.

The trade power being evaluated is province-specific only and ignores global trade power modifiers, also it only aggregates the values from provinces allocated to trade companies in that node (hence normal territories or states in that node are not counted).

![Colonists icon](/images/thumb/3/34/Colonists.png/40px-Colonists.png "Colonists icon")

Colonists are used to found new colonies in Uncolonized Land.

_See also: [Colonization#Colonists](/Colonization#Colonists "Colonization")_  

Colonists are sent to uncolonised provinces to govern and expand a colony. They can be kept in a colony in order to increase the chance of gaining extra settlers each month, but can also be recalled from a colony in progress for other missions after setting up a colony (such as setting up an additional colony, although each colony over the number of available colonists will rapidly grow in cost). With [![Dharma.png](/images/thumb/f/fc/Dharma.png/28px-Dharma.png)](/Dharma "Dharma"), colonists can be sent to provinces to allow the province to increase [![Development.png](/images/thumb/a/a4/Development.png/28px-Development.png)](/Development "Development") [development](/Development "Development"); when and which area (base tax, production, and manpower) the increase in development occurs is random, with chances decreasing as the province becomes more developed.

The default number of available colonists is zero; unlike the other types of envoys, countries generally do not begin the game with colonists, and instead gain them by taking ideas or as part of their national ideas.

**Gaining colonists**

Travel time depends on the distance envoys must travel from the player's capital. It differs between the different envoy-types:

*   A [![Diplomat.png](/images/thumb/e/ee/Diplomat.png/28px-Diplomat.png)](/Diplomat "Diplomat") diplomat performs (or, for maintained actions, begins) their action instantly, then spends time travelling back.
*   A [![Merchants.png](/images/thumb/2/24/Merchants.png/28px-Merchants.png)](/Merchant "Merchant") merchant spends time travelling both to and from the destination. A merchant can be sent directly between trade nodes without having to return to the capital.
*   A [![Missionaries.png](/images/thumb/a/ad/Missionaries.png/28px-Missionaries.png)](/Missionary "Missionary") missionary is both sent and recalled instantly.
*   A [![Colonists.png](/images/thumb/3/34/Colonists.png/28px-Colonists.png)](/Colonist "Colonist") colonist spends time travelling to the destination, but is recalled instantly after waiting one day. (See [Colonization#Travel\_time](/Colonization#Travel_time "Colonization") for further information on colonist travel time).
