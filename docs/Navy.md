The basic unit of naval forces is predictably the ship. Each ship is classed as [_heavy_](/Naval_units#Heavy_ships "Naval units"), [_light_](/Naval_units#Light_ships "Naval units"), [_galley_](/Naval_units#Galleys "Naval units") or [_transport_](/Naval_units#Transports "Naval units").

Ships are grouped into fleets. Each fleet can be led by an [admiral or explorer](/Military_leader "Military leader"). A fleet travels at the [speed](/Naval_units#Movement_speed "Naval units") of its slowest ship class.

Building ships requires an owned, cored and controlled [![Province icon.png](/images/thumb/1/13/Province_icon.png/28px-Province_icon.png)](/Province "Province") province with a port, [![Gold Icon.png](/images/2/26/Gold_Icon.png)](/Ducats "Ducats")ducats to pay for the costs of the ship, [![Time Icon.png](/images/7/70/Time_Icon.png)](/Time "Time") time to build the ship and [![Sailors.png](/images/thumb/8/8f/Sailors.png/28px-Sailors.png)](/Sailors "Sailors") [sailors](/Sailors "Sailors"). Each province can build one ship at a time, though multiple ships can be queued up in a single province.

The base cost and building time of a ship depends on its type, and is then adjusted by any modifiers, in particular those coming from buildings the province might have. Ships start with 50% of maximum [![Morale of navies.png](/images/thumb/8/80/Morale_of_navies.png/28px-Morale_of_navies.png)](/Morale_of_navies "Morale of navies") morale when they have been built. Going over the [![Naval forcelimit.png](/images/thumb/9/98/Naval_forcelimit.png/28px-Naval_forcelimit.png)](/Naval_forcelimit "Naval forcelimit") naval forcelimit will result in higher maintenance cost.

Unlike land units, ships do not automatically upgrade to new models as technology advances. Fleets are modernised by building new ships, or by manually [upgrading](/Navy#Upgrading_ships "Navy") existing ships with the [![Art of War.png](/images/thumb/0/0f/Art_of_War.png/28px-Art_of_War.png)](/Art_of_War "Art of War") [Art of War](/Art_of_War "Art of War") DLC enabled.

### Ship cost\[[edit](/index.php?title=Navy&veaction=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Ship cost") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Navy&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Ship cost")\]

The ducat cost for ships is computed as follows:

![\text{ship cost} = \text{base cost} \cdot \left( 100% +  \sum\text{ship cost modifiers} \right)](https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/png/8732fc33f5af69ea89444f85abee904cea81233d)

The sailor cost of building ships is depends on the ship model and does not get changed by any existing modifiers.

#### Base cost\[[edit](/index.php?title=Navy&veaction=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Base cost") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Navy&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Base cost")\]

The base cost for building ships is:[\[1\]](#cite_note-defines-1)

#### Ship cost modifiers\[[edit](/index.php?title=Navy&veaction=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Ship cost modifiers") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Navy&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Ship cost modifiers")\]

Ship cost can be affected by general and ship type-specific modifiers which are added additively.

##### General modifiers\[[edit](/index.php?title=Navy&veaction=edit&section=6 "Edit section: General modifiers") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Navy&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: General modifiers")\]

General modifiers reduce the ducat cost of all types of [naval units](/Naval_units "Naval units"). All modifiers that reduce the cost of new ships also reduce the maintenance of existing ships by a corresponding amount.

Available only with the [Leviathan](/Leviathan "Leviathan") DLC enabled.

The government reforms [Eastern Plutocracy](/Eastern_Plutocracy "Eastern Plutocracy"), [Kongsi Federation](/Kongsi_Federation "Kongsi Federation"), [Livonian Admiralty](/Livonian_Admiralty "Livonian Admiralty") and [Livonian Plutocracy](/Livonian_Plutocracy "Livonian Plutocracy"), allow the cheap drafting of transport ships.  
This adds a new template to the macrobuilder, which will dynamically include enough transports so that after building it, 80% of the force limit will be made up of transports.  
Building these tranports will only take 50% of the normal time and cost 20% less sailors.  
The monetary cost will be 1 years worth of income, multiplied by the percentage of forcelimit thats being build (80% = 0.8).  
At the least, they will be 20% cheaper than regular transports (this is relevant for nations with very high yearly income).  
The lowest price the template can reach is 1 ducat per ship (this is relevant for poor nations), unaffected by further reductions to ship cost.  
Exept for this, reductions to ship cost interact normally with drafting.

When docked in an owned and controlled port, ships can be upgraded individually or at the fleet level. When an upgrade is triggered, the relevant ship(s) are replaced instantly, but reduced to an initial 1% condition to simulate the replacement ship being built virtually from scratch. For each ship, an upgrade costs the same amount of ducats as building a new ship.

Advantages of upgrading include:

*   The 'construction' process (i.e. repairing the ship from its initial 1% condition) takes only 10 months, which is generally faster than simply building a new ship, especially for heavies.
*   Upgrades bypass the build queue and so are not limited in speed by the availability of coastal provinces for building.
*   The original name of each upgraded ship is maintained.
*   Upgrading is more convenient than manually destroying older ships and building new ones.
*   Upgrading, rather than disbanding and rebuilding, maintains the presence of a fleet where that is desirable, e.g. for deterring attack. (Alternatively one could temporarily go over force limit before disposing of the excess ships.)

Disadvantages:

*   Repairing from 1% does not benefit from ship construction speed bonuses. (But it does benefit from ship repair bonuses, and repairing is generally faster anyway.)
*   Upgrading destroys the value embodied in the old ship, which could have been partially recouped by selling it to another country. Selling and rebuilding can therefore be more cost effective, where there are countries willing to buy.

Each ship costs ducats to upkeep every month. By class, the base ship maintenance depends on the type of ship and is proportional to the _cost_ to build the ship along with a defined _ship maintenance factor_, based on ship type. This cost in turn is then multiplied by global cost modifiers to obtain the total cost per month for that specific ship.

Naval maintenance can be computed as follows:

![\text{naval maintenance}_\text{ship} = \left(\text{base naval maintenance}_\text{ship type} \right) \cdot \left( 100% + \text{naval maintenance modifier}_\text{tech} \right) \cdot \left( 100% + \sum\text{naval maintenance modifiers}_\text{non-tech} \right) \cdot \left( 100% + \sum\text{build cost modifiers} \right)](https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/png/695d01fe108ed28471b0464f0f0013c049a28038)

Where:

![\text{base naval maintenance}_\text{ship type} = \left( \text{ship cost} \right) \cdot \left[ \text{trunc} \left( \frac{\text{maintenance factor}} {12} , 3 \right) \right] ](https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/png/7ff998ea8cb32e730515191d821d9a273a81bfb9)

In this case, the game truncates all digits to the right of the third digit after the decimal point. For example:

![\operatorname{trunc}(0.0036,3) = 0.003](https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/png/33f5bca7b5bb83baa204c8f90fb2e67bd036175e)

*   Being over naval force limit will multiply the maintenance cost of ships by the force limit proportion. For example, if a country has 10 ships on a force limit of 5, maintenance is doubled.
*   Practically speaking, for a homogeneous fleet, the marginal maintenance of the first ship built or captured above the naval force limit is about 2\* normal. For example, being at 100% of the force limit will result in the next ship adding about 200% of its normal maintenance, with this multiplier increasing by 2x per multiple of the force limit reached.
*   Light Ships suffer the penalty to their build cost as well, which squares the effect on maintenance cost. For example, being at 150% of the force limit with all Light Ships will result in navy maintenance being 225% of normal. In this case, the marginal maintenance is about 3\* the force limit proportion squared. For example, being at 150% of the force limit with all Light Ships will result in the next light ship adding about 675% of its normal maintenance.
*   Unlike land units, the tech modifier to Naval maintenance stacks multiplicatively with other modifiers. Thus, reductions to Naval Maintenance keep their strength better throughout the game than their land counterpart.
*   For a homogeneous fleet, the marginal maintenance of each ship is about twice the force limit proportion. For example, being at 150% of the force limit will result in the next ship adding about 300% of its normal maintenance.

#### Mothballing\[[edit](/index.php?title=Navy&veaction=edit&section=22 "Edit section: Mothballing") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Navy&action=edit&section=22 "Edit section: Mothballing")\]

"Mothballing" a fleet, thus lowering the maintenance cost of a fleet to the minimum (50%) for the specific fleet. Ship condition and [![Sailors.png](/images/thumb/8/8f/Sailors.png/28px-Sailors.png)](/Sailors "Sailors")sailors will decrease at 5% per month down to a minimum of 25% while the fleet is mothballed, and will be repaired back to full strength at the normal rate (10% per month by default) when returned to active service, which can be done at any time. Mothballed fleets cannot be moved and can only be combined with other mothballed fleets, though they can be split into smaller fleets as usual.

While quantity is an important factor in naval warfare, quality could be considered even more crucial. Because of the limited amount of ships that can fire at the same time in a naval battle, ships that hit harder will quickly take the upper hand in a fight

Several [idea groups](/Idea_groups "Idea groups") can be taken to progressively improve a navy's performance on the battlefield. Additionally, some nations get specific bonuses resembling the strength their navy had in actual history.

### General improvements\[[edit](/index.php?title=Navy&veaction=edit&section=24 "Edit section: General improvements") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Navy&action=edit&section=24 "Edit section: General improvements")\]

The main improvement of a fleet is performed by replacing or upgrading [naval units](/Naval_units "Naval units") as [diplomatic technology](/Diplomatic_technology "Diplomatic technology") improves. New ship types are unlocked at several diplomatic technology levels. Ships will have to be rebuilt or upgraded in order for them to receive the bonuses from a newer ship type. In addition to ship types, diplomatic technology also improves naval morale at certain levels.

#### Combat ability improvements\[[edit](/index.php?title=Navy&veaction=edit&section=25 "Edit section: Combat ability improvements") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Navy&action=edit&section=25 "Edit section: Combat ability improvements")\]

Combat ability is a value that is multiplied with the units' damage dealt (both for casualties and morale), but only for the specified type of unit.

Fleets can be led by either an [admiral or an explorer](/Military_leader "Military leader"). The only combat difference between the two is that the admiral will get more pips, on average, when he's created. Having a naval leader in a battle greatly improves the combat ability of the fleet.

### Supply range\[[edit](/index.php?title=Navy&veaction=edit&section=31 "Edit section: Supply range") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Navy&action=edit&section=31 "Edit section: Supply range")\]

The supply range is a key factor in determining where [light ships](/Light_ships "Light ships") can be sent to [protect trade](/Protect_trade "Protect trade"), and it determines whether ships suffer attrition or not. Base supply range is 150. It can be extended by the trade range modifiers below:

*   Supply range cannot be extended by flat trade range modifier. [Technology](/Technology#Diplomatic "Technology"), for instance, only increases the trade range by a fixed number and therefor does not influence the supply range.\* A good way to arrange for a favorable supply range is by gaining [fleet basing rights](/Fleet_basing_rights "Fleet basing rights") from a nation in the vicinity of where attrition is undesired and/or ship repairs are needed.

### Attrition\[[edit](/index.php?title=Navy&veaction=edit&section=32 "Edit section: Attrition") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Navy&action=edit&section=32 "Edit section: Attrition")\]

Navies suffer from attrition from being in the open seas or being far away from port too long. A navy does not suffer attrition if it is within naval supply range' and in a coastal zone (open sea always causes attrition). Sea zones that contain a dockable port also count as home waters and will never cause attrition, even if it is outside naval supply range.

Having your Navy in a Sea Tile adjacent to a Province that has either the [Naval Battery](/Buildings#Naval_Battery "Buildings") Building or the [Cartagena de Indias Fort System](/Cartagena_de_Indias_Fort_System "Cartagena de Indias Fort System") Monument while being at war with the province owner, will cause attrition, even if you normally wouldnt suffer attrition in that tile.

Attrition damage is governed by the following rules:

*   Monthly attrition damage equal to the listed attrition percentage will be applied to all ships in a fleet at the beginning of each month.
*   Movement into any sea province has a 50% chance to cause any ship to take attrition damage unless they immediately engage in combat. Be aware that two fleets will only engage in combat if at least one of them is stationary.
*   Explorers leading a fleet give a chance to all ships under their command to avoid any source of attrition damage. This allows fleets led by explorers to travel much farther than normal. The chance of avoidance appears to improve with the health of each ship, and decreases with the amount of attrition damage that must be avoided. Fleets lead by explorers in coastal seas have a particularly high chance of avoiding attrition damage.
*   In [![El Dorado.png](/images/thumb/1/16/El_Dorado.png/28px-El_Dorado.png)](/El_Dorado "El Dorado") El Dorado, a fleet engaged in regional exploration (exploring water or coast) will not suffer any attrition, regardless of its location and time at sea. A fleet on global circumnavigation mission will have attrition as usual. However, the fleet on exploration mission will not receive any further commands until it returns to a home port.

The following factors influence naval attrition:

AI navies do not take attrition damage as the AI is unable to adequately manage it. Internal game rules instead limit how far the AI can send their fleet for exploration or combat.

### Ship repair\[[edit](/index.php?title=Navy&veaction=edit&section=33 "Edit section: Ship repair") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Navy&action=edit&section=33 "Edit section: Ship repair")\]

Ships which have sustained damage (i.e. their condition is lower than 100%) will automatically repair up to 100% condition when docked in any province. Any number of ships can be repaired by a single port at once with no penalty to repair speed.

Importantly, since damaged ships operate at a reduced sailor capacity, repaired ships will consume additional sailors from the sailor pool. This means that if you do not have any sailors left in your pool then no ships can be repaired until you do - in such a case only the number of sailors recruited during that month will be applied to repair ships that you have stationed in a port. Therefore repairs will creep up only at your monthly recruitment rate.

Note that repair speeds are faster in a port where a shipyard (**+25%** ship repair) and grand shipyard (**+50%** ship repair) are present.

#### Automatic docking for repairs\[[edit](/index.php?title=Navy&veaction=edit&section=34 "Edit section: Automatic docking for repairs") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Navy&action=edit&section=34 "Edit section: Automatic docking for repairs")\]

Once a fleet's average morale value has been reduced enough, a fleet will attempt automatic docking to a nearby port for repair and morale recovery. In the mission settings, a fleet's repair threshold can be set, determining how much damage a fleet can take before going to a port for repairs.

#### Rate of repair\[[edit](/index.php?title=Navy&veaction=edit&section=35 "Edit section: Rate of repair") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Navy&action=edit&section=35 "Edit section: Rate of repair")\]

Ships will automatically be repaired on the first day of each month if they are docked in port. The repair amount is **10%**[\[4\]](#cite_note-4) at full naval maintenance, and will decrease linearly to 0% at minimum naval maintenance. Repair speed is affected by certain modifiers.
