**Casus belli** is a Latin term meaning _case of war_. In [the game](/Europa_Universalis_IV "Europa Universalis IV"), a country with a casus belli (commonly abbreviated to "CB") on another country is deemed to have a valid cause for war. When [declaring war](/Declaration_of_War "Declaration of War"), the player is presented with a list of available CBs. They may pick a CB from the list or choose to declare war without a casus belli and accept the penalties of **+20** base aggressive expansion[\[1\]](#cite_note-1) and **−2** [![Stability.png](/images/a/ae/Stability.png)](/Stability "Stability") stability (halved with full [Diplomatic ideas](/Diplomatic_ideas "Diplomatic ideas")).

Each casus belli has a particular **[war goal](/War_goal "War goal")** associated with it, generally either controlling a particular province or winning a certain proportion of battles. Meeting the war goal will cause the warscore of whichever side has achieved it to gradually rise (up to a max bonus of 25% at a rate of +0.4% per month).

The casus belli also determines what peace terms may be demanded at no or reduced [![Diplomatic power.png](/images/d/da/Diplomatic_power.png)](/Diplomatic_power "Diplomatic power") diplomatic power cost; additionally, some CBs disallow some peace terms entirely. Extracting additional concessions beyond those of the original CB (**[unjustified demands](/Unjustified_demands "Unjustified demands")**) will cost [![Diplomatic power.png](/images/d/da/Diplomatic_power.png)](/Diplomatic_power "Diplomatic power") diplomatic power to be demanded.

Please help improve this article or section by [**expanding it**](https://eu4.paradoxwikis.com/index.php?title=Casus_belli&action=edit) with: Imperial Reconquest CB; religious requirements when calling allies into holy wars;wargoal changes from patch 1.33.

### War goals\[[edit](/index.php?title=Casus_belli&veaction=edit&section=2 "Edit section: War goals") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Casus_belli&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: War goals")\]

Each CB has an associated war goal. This describes what each side has to do to get ticking warscore, i.e. additional warscore over time from having accomplished the goal. Wargoals include:

*   Take province / Defend province: Control a specific province. This may be a province chosen on declaring the war, or the capital. Each side gets ticking warscore as long as they control the target. Neither side gets ticking warscore if a third party (e.g. rebels) controls it.
*   Show superiority: Have at least 10% warscore from battles. No side gets ticking warscore if neither has said warscore from battles
*   Blockade ports: Amount and rate of ticking warscore scales by the proportion of blockading.

### Triggered\[[edit](/index.php?title=Casus_belli&veaction=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Triggered") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Casus_belli&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Triggered")\]

A triggered casus belli appears when certain actions are performed (like insulting other countries), and can also be given by events and missions. Triggered casus belli only last for a certain amount of time before they expire and are no longer valid. Without [![Art of War.png](/images/thumb/0/0f/Art_of_War.png/28px-Art_of_War.png)](/Art_of_War "Art of War") [Art of War](/Art_of_War "Art of War"), none of these CBs can be used by an overlord on a subject's behalf. The duration of the CBs is listed in months.

Unless otherwise noted, aggressive expansion, prestige and warscore cost modifiers and affected peace offers are the ones for the attacker only; for the defender, they are all 100% and the defender can also take provinces without spending diplomatic power.

Having a claim allows the selection of the targeted province as a wargoal. The covert [Fabricate Claims](/Espionage#Fabricate_claims "Espionage") diplomatic action provides a claim on a single province (for details of which provinces can have claims fabricated on them, see [Espionage § Covert actions](/Espionage#Covert_actions "Espionage")). This is an immediate action that costs a certain number of points of spy network strength, starting at 20 and increasing by **5** spy network points per existing claim. In addition, many missions, events and unification national [decisions](/Decisions "Decisions") give permanent or temporary claims, sometimes on a large region. There are also some events, such as Border Friction, that allow claims to be gained.

A temporary claim will expire in 25 years after a nation first gets the claim (permanent claims never expire). A claim can't expire during a war with the province's owner; permanent claims never expire, though they can still be given up in a peace deal. Regardless of CB used, claims provide [![Core-creation cost.png](/images/thumb/5/56/Core-creation_cost.png/28px-Core-creation_cost.png)](/Core-creation_cost "Core-creation cost") **−10%** core creation cost, or **−25%** for a permanent claim.

Choosing a CB\[[edit](/index.php?title=Casus_belli&veaction=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Choosing a CB") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Casus_belli&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Choosing a CB")\]

Conquest is ordinarily the easiest CB to get by simply [fabricating](/Fabricate "Fabricate") a [claim](/Claim "Claim"), but also the least useful. Taking too many provinces can quickly result in a large [coalition](/Coalition "Coalition") being formed against the country due to [aggressive expansion](/Aggressive_expansion "Aggressive expansion") (AE). It is still desirable to fabricate claims before fighting, in order to reduce coring cost and time, and the diplomatic point cost.

*   Holy War and Cleansing of Heresy work on any heathen or heretic, which also removes diplomatic point cost for taking any province, and are both unlocked by the last Religious idea.
*   If you have a special CB due to your government form or religion that allows you to take land, you'll usually be better off using it when possible, since it's tailored to your needs. Claims are still useful in these situations, but not strictly necessary. [Daimyo](/Japan "Japan"), [Maya](/Pagan_denominations#Mayan "Pagan denominations") reforming the religion, the Emperor of China, and steppe hordes all want to conquer land with less AE and maybe warscore cost, while [Nahuatl](/Pagan_denominations#Nahuatl "Pagan denominations") trying to reform the religion want cheaper vassalization. The revolution target wants to Spread the Revolution (in fact it can hardly do much more), while their monarchist neighbours want to Crush the Revolution.
    *   Becoming [revolutionary](/Revolution "Revolution") is a common world conquest strategy, because the bonuses of being the revolution target and the reduced warscore and diplomatic power cost of the revolutionary CB, in combination with [![Administrative efficiency.png](/images/thumb/6/6e/Administrative_efficiency.png/28px-Administrative_efficiency.png)](/Administrative_efficiency "Administrative efficiency") administrative efficiency from high [![Revolutionary zeal.png](/images/thumb/d/d5/Revolutionary_zeal.png/28px-Revolutionary_zeal.png)](/Revolutionary_zeal "Revolutionary zeal") revolutionary zeal, make it possible to conquer huge amounts of land very quickly.
*   Note that a casus belli only reduces the cost of provinces that fulfill its criteria. For instance, Colonialism has 25% aggressive expansion and 50% warscore cost, but only for taking provinces that are overseas for both or from overseas colonial nations. Provinces on the same continent as the target's capital or directly connected to the capital will incur full costs (unless they're a colonial nation). When choosing such a CB, it will list the names of all the applying provinces, or show the number of these provinces if there are too many.
*   Also note that the reduced warscore cost also affects options that are set on total province cost. So if a country's warscore cost is just over 100, the reduced cost for being wargoal might just make the country annexable/vassalizable.

If the goal of the war is not to seize territory or force-vassalize, then the choice of CB is less important, since extorting money or releasing nations doesn't cause AE. Conquest is fine to use in such a situation. If the country happens to be a rival and releasing vassals or countries is not desired, the special Humiliate Rival CB is ideally suited for this purpose. The drawback is that allies can't be called in on a promise of land with a CB that can't be used to fulfil that promise, so you will need favours.
