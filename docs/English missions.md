[![Raise an Army icon](/images/7/7a/Mission_rb_unite_the_clans.png)](/File:Mission_rb_unite_the_clans.png "Raise an Army icon")

Raise an Army

Traditionally, the \[Root.GetParliamentOrFallbackName\] opposes any attempt of a standing army for the royal house. Instead, our \[Root.GovernmentName\] relies on the effort of militia, mercenaries and the levies of the \[Root.GetNobilityName\]. As the Hundred Years' War is going through its last phases and the Scots are posing a threat to our security, it is only natural that we must raise an army one way or another.

*   Army size is at least 80% of force limit

[![The Acts of Union icon](/images/e/ed/Mission_empire.png)](/File:Mission_empire.png "The Acts of Union icon")

The Acts of Union
