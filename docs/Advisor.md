Please help improve this article or section by [**expanding it**](https://eu4.paradoxwikis.com/index.php?title=Advisor&action=edit) with: information about type-specific advisor cost modifiers.

[](/File:Advisor_example.png "Enlarge")

Advisors are located on the [government](/Government "Government") interface

An **advisor** is a person with deep knowledge in a specific area that offers advice to a country's leader. Tasks such as [conducting warfare](/War "War"), [promoting scientific advancement](/Technology "Technology") and [managing an economy](/Economy "Economy") are three examples of areas an advisor can offer aid.

Advisors can be managed in the Court panel of the [Country interface](/Country_interface "Country interface"). In [EU4](/EU4 "EU4"), there are 7 advisors for each of the three kinds of [monarch power](/Monarch_power "Monarch power"), so there are 21 advisor types in total. Each advisor provides a fixed bonus based on his type. For example, all Traders increase trade efficiency by 10%.

Advisors are further divided by their inherent skill level. Skill ranges from **+1** to **+5**, each providing additional [monarch points](/Monarch_points "Monarch points") relative to their level (i.e. a level 2 diplomat provides **+2** [![Diplomatic power.png](/images/d/da/Diplomatic_power.png)](/Diplomatic_power "Diplomatic power") per month). (Note that in the Base game, without the Promote Advisors mechanic unlocked in the Cradle of Civilization DLC, **+3** will be the cap. The cost of hiring and maintaining an advisor increases quadratically with the advisor's skill level. The advisor's skill level affects only the cost and the monarch power generated. The skill level does not affect the advisor type bonus (e.g. a level 1 and a level 3 Philosopher will output the same amount of [![Yearly prestige.png](/images/thumb/f/f3/Yearly_prestige.png/28px-Yearly_prestige.png)](/Prestige "Prestige") prestige).

If the [![Government republic.png](/images/thumb/5/5d/Government_republic.png/28px-Government_republic.png)](/Republic "Republic") Government Reform "Attorney General" is enacted, [![Advisor.png](/images/thumb/6/6a/Advisor.png/28px-Advisor.png)](/Advisor "Advisor") Advisors wil also increase [![Yearly republican tradition.png](/images/thumb/6/68/Yearly_republican_tradition.png/28px-Yearly_republican_tradition.png)](/Yearly_republican_tradition "Yearly republican tradition") yearly Republican Tradition by **0.02** times their Level

Advisors eventually die and must be replaced.

Please help with verifying or updating this section. It was last verified for [version](/Europa_Universalis_4_Wiki:Versioning "Europa Universalis 4 Wiki:Versioning") 1.24.

A country can only have one active advisor of each type at a time; however, there are ways to increase the pool of options to choose from. In the 1444 start, each country starts with a pool of at least 3 advisor choices for each type. Countries with a [total monthly income](/Economy#Income "Economy") of less than [![Gold Icon.png](/images/2/26/Gold_Icon.png)](/Ducats "Ducats")50 ducats will not have access to level 3 advisors (except by event). Each country has access to at least one skill 2 advisor at start.

### Gaining new advisors\[[edit](/index.php?title=Advisor&veaction=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Gaining new advisors") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Advisor&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Gaining new advisors")\]

New advisors will only arrive upon event or when a free slot is opened, either by increasing the advisor pool or a previous advisor dying. If the [![Common Sense.png](/images/thumb/e/e4/Common_Sense.png/28px-Common_Sense.png)](/Common_Sense "Common Sense") [Common Sense](/Common_Sense "Common Sense") expansion is activated, the player may also spend the initial cost of hiring an advisor to remove them from court. New advisors will appear at the start of the month.

Notifications can be set to alert the player of the arrival of new advisors. Advisors begin to have a chance of dying once they are past **age 40**, and new advisors will always be at least **age 30**. The consequently low rate of replacement means it is typically not worth waiting for an ideal advisor. Picking idea groups that give extra advisor slots can improve the odds of having an advisor with the desired abilities.

#### Female advisors\[[edit](/index.php?title=Advisor&veaction=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Female advisors") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Advisor&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Female advisors")\]

New advisors have a 2% chance of being female. This chance can be increased by the following:

[![](/images/thumb/6/63/Advisor_expenses.png/330px-Advisor_expenses.png)](/File:Advisor_expenses.png)

[](/File:Advisor_expenses.png "Enlarge")

Modifiers affecting advisor salaries can be seen in the Economy panel.

An [![Advisor cost.png](/images/thumb/4/4d/Advisor_cost.png/28px-Advisor_cost.png)](/File:Advisor_cost.png) advisor's cost depends on their skill, the current year, and other modifiers (if any). Hiring costs depend on their age, while monthly costs do not. Historical advisors receive a discount to employ.

Active modifiers can be seen by hovering over "Advisors" in the "Expenses" column of the Economy panel. These values show multiple decimals points (see picture for example).

### Monthly cost\[[edit](/index.php?title=Advisor&veaction=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Monthly cost") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Advisor&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Monthly cost")\]

The monthly cost of an advisor is calculated from a base amount, which is the square of their skill level (1, 4, 9, 16 or 25). This base cost increases over time by **0.5%** of the original base cost every year. Thus by 1644 (200 years), the base costs of 1, 4, and 9 will double to 2, 8, and 18. By the end of game time (1821, 377 years), they will be 2.88 times (base + 188.5% base) the starting value. Any additional increases from modifiers are calculated from this new base cost.

### Hiring cost\[[edit](/index.php?title=Advisor&veaction=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Hiring cost") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Advisor&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Hiring cost")\]

The one-time hiring cost is a simple multiple of the monthly salary. The advisor's skill level only enters into the hiring cost inasmuch as his skill level has already helped determine his salary.

As hiring costs are multiples of the monthly cost, they also increase over the years.

The value of the multiplier depends solely on the advisor's age, ranging from a high of **16** at age 30 (the youngest age possible) down to **10** at age 60. (The oldest advisors available in the pool are rarely more than their high 50s.) It is strictly linear, dropping 0.2 per year (a.k.a., a whole point every five years). The advisor's age is used "as is"; there are no hidden fractions for being, e.g., "50 and a half".

![{\displaystyle {\text{Hiring cost}}=\left(22-{\frac {\text{age}}{5}}\right)\cdot {\text{monthly salary}}}](https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/png/bdef141ca32a2c9e02e349c6dd26b4d4e87ea77b)

For more regarding age, see the section on Longevity (below).

### Example\[[edit](/index.php?title=Advisor&veaction=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Example") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Advisor&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Example")\]

For a 50 year old Skill 2 advisor (base 4 per month) in the year 1544, with inflation of 10%:

![{\displaystyle {\text{Base cost}}=4\cdot (1+0.005\cdot 100)=6.00{\text{ per month}}}](https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/png/e77f2196c9df6f69f9361055a3294fc0fab2acf5)

![{\displaystyle {\text{Total monthly cost}}=6\cdot (1+0.10)=6.60{\text{ per month}}}](https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/png/a6f8381160b384259c476a4163eb8d6210c72bba)

![{\displaystyle {\text{Hiring cost}}=(22-10)\cdot 6.60=79.2}](https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/png/d5290c713ba46cd0f8dffef569614460491727e3)

### Factors modifying advisor cost\[[edit](/index.php?title=Advisor&veaction=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Factors modifying advisor cost") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Advisor&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Factors modifying advisor cost")\]

Note that these modifiers are applied _after_ applying the change in base cost due to the current year.

It is possible at any point to promote the rank of an advisor once they are hired, provided they are of an [![Max promoted cultures.png](/images/thumb/8/8b/Max_promoted_cultures.png/28px-Max_promoted_cultures.png)](/Max_promoted_cultures "Max promoted cultures") accepted culture, to a max rank of 5. This can be done for the cost of 60 times the advisor's monthly salary (the cost of a 5-year salary).

As advisor's monthly salary increases quadratically with rank; it is recommended to make sure the economy can sustain the cost before promoting the advisor. With this, an even higher emphasis is put on advisor age as they are less likely to die early and risk the loss of investment.

[](/File:EU4_Advisor_Age_versus_Mortality_and_Survival.jpg "Enlarge")

EU4 Advisor Life Expectancy

Once an advisor is hired, their tooltip will display their percentage death risk, which depends on their age.

For every year over 40, advisors gain 2/3rds of a percent (0.67%) chance of death, or an increase of 2% for every 3 years of age after 40. At age 55, the yearly death risk will be 10%. At age 100, it will be 40%. The percentage is rounded down in the tooltip, but probably not in calculations. This means that at age 41, an advisor's yearly death risk will be 0.67%, but will show as 0% in the tooltip.

![{\displaystyle {\text{Death rate}}=\left({\text{Age}}-40\right)\cdot {\frac {2}{3}}\ \%/{\text{year}}}](https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/png/c8e4832f6b280bd473d80c08fe1a41439ebde8e6)

The cumulative effects of this are severe (inset at left). By a median age of 53.7, only half of advisors will be alive. By 65, only 1 in 10 will remain. Only 1 in 100 will make it to 75. (This is the overall mortality curve; if an advisor has already survived to 50, their curve is different.)

![Strategy](/images/thumb/a/a2/Years_of_separatism.png/36px-Years_of_separatism.png "Strategy") _The below is **one of many** player suggested strategies for **Advisor**. Bear in mind, due to the dynamic nature of the game, it may unfold differently for other players._

### When not to use advisors\[[edit](/index.php?title=Advisor&veaction=edit&section=19 "Edit section: When not to use advisors") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Advisor&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: When not to use advisors")\]

Advisors are powerful, but costly in ducats. In this regard, hiring and maintaining advisors is a trade-off: ducats spent on advisors cannot be stockpiled, or spent on army or navy.

In certain circumstances, it may be strategically beneficial to leave some advisor slots vacant, or even to have no advisors at all for a period of time.

Such circumstances include:

*   **Playing as a small country with a weak economy at game start.** For some countries, even a single +1 advisor can be very expensive in relative terms at the start of the game. Military conquest can be helpful in expanding the economy (and thereby affording advisors in future), but the army must be paid.
*   **Engaging in costly wars.** Army maintenance and reinforcement are both costly. It can sometimes be decisively advantageous to hire some mercenaries, or to hire additional regiments beyond the forcelimit. Spending too heavily on advisors at the same time may drive the country into debt.
*   **Paying off a heavy loan debt.** If loans are being paid off too slowly, inflation will repeatedly climb as the loans are extended. This situation may be improved by firing some existing advisors, or by not replacing advisors after they die, until the loans have been repaid.

### Longevity vs hiring cost\[[edit](/index.php?title=Advisor&veaction=edit&section=20 "Edit section: Longevity vs hiring cost") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Advisor&action=edit&section=20 "Edit section: Longevity vs hiring cost")\]

[![](/images/thumb/5/51/EU4_Advisor_Hiring_Age_versus_Hiring_Multiplier.jpg/240px-EU4_Advisor_Hiring_Age_versus_Hiring_Multiplier.jpg)](/File:EU4_Advisor_Hiring_Age_versus_Hiring_Multiplier.jpg)

EU4 Advisor Life Expectancy

Since the hiring cost decreases with age, and advisors have a [calculable life span](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_table), it is possible to calculate the ideal age to hire an advisor.

It's simple for ages 30 to 40, where the hiring-cost multiplier changes, but the advisors do not die. As [mentioned](#Longevity), the median life expectancy of an advisor is 53.7 years. So if an advisor is hired at age 30, they have an expected useful life of ~24 years (until they're 53.7), at a hiring-cost multiple of 16. This provides 1.5 years of useful life expectancy per hiring multiple (24/16). If an advisor is hired at age 40 (hiring multiple 14), they have 14 years of expected life, or 1.0 years per multiple (14/14). Clearly, the 30 year old advisor is the better bargain.

At ages over 40, the mortality curve begins to change; their median life expectancy (expected age of death) increases as their actual age of hiring increases. (An advisor who is already 55 is obviously no longer expected to die at 53.7.) While the Useful Years in the graph was a straight line between ages 30 and 40 (because there is no mortality there), it becomes a curve at 40. Thus, the useful life expectancy drops faster than the hiring-cost multiplier, which means that younger advisors are better. By 50 one has reached 0.59 years per multiplier, and by 60, it is 0.42.

Still, while 30 years may be the best relative bargain, the hiring multiplier only has a range of 10 to 16, which is to say, there's only half a year's salary involved in any case. There will likely not be a significant impact on the player's income, unless they are very low on it. The effects of the advisor's special bonus are generally more significant.
