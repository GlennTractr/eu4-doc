_After Muscovites invaded Novgorod in 1471 and Lithuania failed to come to Novgorod's assistance, Novgorod was forced to accept the Korostyn' Treaty, which further limited its independence. Ivan III, still wary of uprisings because of what happened to his father, deported many of the citizens of Novgorod. He also replaced leaders of the Novgorodian church with Russian Orthodox leaders. Lands were taken from the natives and given to cavalrymen in return for military service. After establishing the reform of land management, called the pomestie system, there, he introduced it into Muscovite. By seizing the local nobles', called boyars, estates and giving it to his army, he helped bolster and centralize his power and create loyalty in his army and other servants. By 1489, Novgorod was a shell of its former self and now part of the ever-growing Russian state._

_In 1552, Czar Ivan IV the Terrible had launched an expedition against the Khanate of Kazan, east of Nizhny-Novgorod and a blocking point on the Volga. The use of heavy bombard guns breached the walls of the Tatar city, which was promptly overwhelmed and annexed. In 1556, in the wake of his success against Kazan four years earlier, Czar Ivan IV the Terrible launched a new expedition against the Khanate of Astrakhan, southward down the Volga. The capture of Astrakhan opened an access to the Caspian Sea and put the whole Volga basin under Russian control. Cities like Samara (1586), Saratov (1590) and Tsaritsyne (1589) were founded along the river to ensure proper control._

_Ivan IV of Russia had extended the borders of his homeland far to the South and the East, but had met with strong resistance in the West, in particular in Livonia. Wars with Poland, Lithuania (then a part of Poland) and even Sweden would last till 1583. Poland had annexed Lithuania in 1569 and, after many defeats at the hands of the Polish army, Ivan had to sign a peace treaty in 1582 where he lost all his previous western territorial gains. Enmity between the two countries would remain high, culminating with the Polish occupation of Moscow (1610) during the Time of Troubles (1598-1618)._

_Immediately after the fall of Astrakhan, in the year 1557, Ivan IV launched a campaign in the steppes south of Kazan, the realm of the Nogaï Horde, heirs of some Mongol people. This was the first stepping stone for the expansion eastward. The Russian expansion eastward, led between 1560 and 1581 by Cossacks under Yermak and the private venture of the Stroganov merchants of Nizhny-Novgorod had seen much land fall under control of the Russian Czar. The conquest of the Khanate of Sibir in 1584 and the destruction of the last realm of Genghis Khan's heirs in Siberia was the last step before the exploration and control of the vast hinterland, that would eventually see the Cossacks build cities out of their Ostrogs (simple fortifications to ensure transit) and reach the Pacific ocean at Okhotsk in 1645._

_Ivan felt that trade with Europe depended on free access to the Baltic and decided to turn his attention westward. In 1558 he went to war in an attempt to establish Russian rule over Livonia. Russia was at first victorious and succeeded in destroying the Livonian knights, but their ally Lithuania became an integral part of Poland in 1569. The war dragged on - while the Swedes (guarding their own interests in Estonia) supported Poland against Russia, the Crimean Tatars attacked Astrakhan and even made an extensive incursion into Russia in 1571 - they sacked and burned Moscow, leaving only the Kremlin standing._

_Some of the most important Russian reforms of Government were instituted by Ivan IV. Ivan had built on the works of Ivan III and bound the Pommiestie-class even closer to the monarchy. He also created a separate Chamber of Finance directly at his disposal, which provided a certain efficiency in the in- and outflow of cash. The abolition of the Kormlenije-system, a payment system for the provincial administration where salaries were paid 'in natura' directly from the hands of the peasants, and the redressing of the provincial administration organization made the monarchy much more efficient and powerful. Unfortunately for Russia, these reforms were not enough to hold the State afloat after the costly and disastrous Livonian Wars at the end of Ivan IV's reign._

_Nikon was the patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church from 1652 to 1666. He undertook an extremely vigorous reform of church discipline and ritual with a view to purging accretions and eccentricities from the Russian rites. His reforms, particularly his correction of service books from the Greek (1654), created a schism in the Church and inspired the formation of a major opposition sect, the Raskolniki, who retained the older usages banned by Nikon. Heterodox sects such as the Dukhobors formed and attached themselves to the Raskolniki to avoid persecution. By 1658, Nikon had aroused sufficiently powerful opposition to bring about his banishment, and in 1666 he was deposed and degraded. He was a figure unique in Russian church history, for he opposed any interference by the state in church affairs and considered the two institutions to be distinct and separate. His reforms were maintained after he was deposed._

_Leading Russian Church officials had noticed a number of discrepancies between Russian and Greek sermons, rites and books, and in 1652 Patriarch Nikon convened a synod to study these matters. A second synod was convened in 1666 where a number of reforms were issued to correct this as well as condemning much of the traditions of the past. This led to a great schism - raskol - where the those who opposed these changes came to be known as Old Believers or raskolniki._

_The Bulavin Rebellion broke out in October 1707 when Kondraty Bulavin and a band of Don Cossacks ambushed and killed a group of bounty hunters sent by Peter the Great to arrest fugitive peasants hiding out in the Don region. The underlying reasons were that Peter's newly-reformed state was expanding, something that had started to infringe on both the Cossack's lands as well as their semi-autonomy. The rebellion turned not against the Tsardom but against Peter and his advisors, who were seen as evil forces whose reforms were seen as trying to destroy Russia._

_Fyodor Baikov went to Beijing in 1656 in an effort to open up diplomatic relations with China. However, misinterpreting the Chinese etiquette made him behave in a way that got the Chinese ministers to believe that Russia acknowledged China as her Master. A message was dispatched to Moscow. The letter contained instructions on the yearly tribute that the vassal 'Russia' must now pay. The Czar had no chance to protest as no one in Moscow could understand Chinese. The Russian government ignored the event as if it has never taken place and China was too busy being subjugated by the Manchu dynasty to care._

_Stenka Razin (or Stepan Timofeyevich) was a Don Cossack hetman who carried out a series of successful raids on Persian and Russian settlements 1667-69. Having acquired great fame and wealth, Razin launched a new campaign in 1670 against the czar's fortress cities on the Volga. With a force of about 7,000 Cossacks, he seized Tsaritsyn and Astrakhan. In both towns Razin and his men engaged in drunken orgies and perpetrated savage atrocities against the nobles and military officers - he also replaced the local governments with Cossack institutions of self-rule. Razin continued his advance up the Volga, and along the way he incited the serfs and urban lower classes to join his rebellion. He captured Saratov and proceeded to Simbirsk, while his insurrection spread throughout the Volga region and even into some of the central Russian provinces. Alarmed at Razin's success, Czar Alexis sent an army to relieve Simbirsk. The force inflicted a decisive defeat on Razin's undisciplined and badly equipped troops. Razin fled to the Don, but on April 24, 1671, he was captured by loyalist Cossacks and turned over to the tsarist authorities. Brought to Moscow and tortured, Razin was executed by quartering in Red Square._

_The permanent Russian exploration and colonization of Siberia that started under Ivan the Terrible, had regularly continued throughout the 17th century, with most of eastern Siberia discovered by the end of the century (Kamchatska was reached in 1679). The Amur basin had been explored by Khabarov in the 1650s and in 1689, a Russo-Chinese border conflict was settled by the first Chinese-European agreement, the Treaty of Nerchinsk, fixing the Amur border. In 1727, the Kyakhta treaty would even make provisions for a Russian trading station to be established in Peking, the capital of the new Manchu dynasty (1644-1911)._

_In 1697, the 15 years old Charles XII ascended the Swedish throne. Seeing the opportunity, the Russian Czar Peter I allied with Denmark and Poland-Saxony in 1699. However, with British and Dutch naval assistance, Charles XII landed on Zealand and promptly defeated the Danes, then moved to Estland where his badly outnumbered Swedes (1 to 5) won a crushing victory over the Russians. Instead of finishing the Russians, Charles moved against August II of Poland-Saxony and drove him out of Poland in 1704 (having the pro-Swedish Stanislaw Leszczynski elected King), then subjugating Saxony in 1706. While the Russians started the construction of St. Petersburg (1703) and rebuilt their armies, they also took parts of Estland (1704-1706). Charles then decided to march to Moscow via the Ukraine where the Cossacks under Mazeppa had again risen in revolt (1708). The harsh winter and Russian raids decimated his army and he was finally beaten at the battle of Poltava in 1709. The wounded king escaped to the Ottomans. The Russians were encircled by the Ottomans on the Prut River, but Peter succeeded through bribery to obtain a safe conduct in exchange for Azov. While Charles was still exiled in Turkey, Russian, Danish, Hanoverian and even Prussian troops captured most of the Swedish provinces around the Baltic. Having emerged from Turkish internment, Charles got killed in 1718 in front of the Norwegian fortress of Frederickshald. The peace treaties that followed Sweden lost most of her Baltic empire._

_In the course of Peter the Great's reign, medieval and obsolescent forms of government gave place to effective autocracy. In 1711 he abolished the boyarskaya duma, or boyar council, and established by decree the Senate as the supreme organ of state to coordinate the action of the various central and local organs, to supervise the collection and expenditure of revenue, and to draft legislation in accordance with his edicts. Martial discipline was extended to civil institutions, and an officer of the guards was always on duty in the Senate. From 1722, moreover, there was a procurator general keeping watch over the daily work of the Senate and its chancellery and acting as 'the eye of the sovereign'._

_The death of the last Duke of Kurland, Frederick William, in 1711, left no heirs to the Duchy except the weak and ill Ferdinand, and a lot of contenders in Russia and Poland. In 1726, the Polish Sejm managed to impose Maurice of Saxony, the bastard son of the current Polish King, as Duke, but only to change her mind and ask his withdrawal. At the same time, Russia was pushing for her own candidate, the Duke of Holstein-Gottorp, son-in-law of the Czarina Catherine I. After much bribing, negotiation and behind the scene diplomacy, Maurice was summoned to either leave or suffer war. It started in 1727, with Russia firmly committed and sending 8,000 troops to conquer the Duchy within 8 days. The war did not last long enough to embrace all of Europe and Maurice fled to France where he then had a brilliant military career._

It was considered too liberal for publication in France and remained a dead letter in Russia._

_The revolt started in 1773 in the Urals region. Led by Emelian Pugatchev, it was an uprising of displaced Cossacks and peasants, following a leader who claimed to be Peter III, the assassinated husband of Czarina Catherine II. In the winter of 1773-1774, the revolt had taken control of most of the Volga basin and even threatened Moscow, bringing the realm of Catherine to the brink of collapse. Finally, regular troops under Suvarow managed to capture Pugatchev near Tsaritsyn and he was executed in Moscow._

_Revolution! The autocratic government has fallen and the \[Root.Monarch.GetTitle\] justly beheaded at Peter’s Square. It is time to create a new Russia, a Revolutionary Russia!_

The new regime takes its leaders from the formerly secret ranks of the Union of Salvation, a cabal of Imperial Army officers who took a stand against oppression and led the uprising against the \[Root.Monarch.GetTitle\]. Pavel Pestel was the ideological heart of the Union, while Mikhael Lunin and Nikita Muraynov led the charge from the front lines. Sergei Trubetskoy, nominally the leader of the Union, has only recently returned to Russia following ill-health. Each places a bid for leadership of the new Russian state.

The revolutionary state aims to abolish serfdom, establish equality under the law, and redistribute the land of oppressive nobles between the State and the peasantry. With a strong foundation in political liberalism, the revolution carries an unwavering resolve to challenge autocracy throughout the world.

_Malyuta Skuratov was one of the most prominent leaders during the Oprichnina - when Ivan the Terrible and his secret police carried out thousands of executions and land confiscations. Skuratov had made a name for himself in 1569 when he participated in the trial and execution of Ivan's only cousin, Vladimir of Staritsa - a possible pretender to the throne. Later that same year he strangled the Metropolitan of Moscow, Philip II, for criticizing the trials, and in 1570 he was responsible for killing thousands of citizens during a punitive expedition to Novgorod. Skuratov was killed in 1573 at the siege of Weissenstein during the Livonian War._

_In 1543, only 14 years old and with astonishing force and bravery, Grand Prince Ivan IV ended the reign of terror of the Boyars. Behind him stood his friend Alexi Adashev and the talented priest Sylvestr, who would succeed the wise Makari as metropolitan of Moscow. Sylvestr and Adashev belonged to a group of advisors called the Chosen Council, which was of great help in reforming Russia during the earlier part of Ivan IV's reign but fell out of favor following the death of Ivan's first wife Anastasia in 1560. Ivan, who had become unbalanced after his grave illness in 1553, accused his old friends of having poisoned his wife and had them exiled, leaving no one to temper his brutality._

_Russian statesman and treasurer with a long career at the Kremlin court. He was brother-in-law and tutor for Tsar Alexis and led the government during Alexis' early reign. Supervising Payroll and the Grand Treasury, Morozov tried to increase the state's income by lowering salaries and introduce new taxes. The high tax on salt caused, and gave name to, the Salt Riot of 1648. After a short exile in a monastery, Morozov was able to return to Moscow where he maintained a low profile while controlling much of the government. He later participated in drafting the Sobornoye Ulozheniye, a new legal code to replace the Sudebnik laws by Ivan III. It cemented serfdom as well as the nobility's exclusive privilege of owning serfs and stipulated class as both hereditary and unchangeable._

_Mikhailo Shcherbatov was an important statesman, historian and philosopher in 18th century Russia. He became a member of the Board of Trade in 1770 and a president of the Chamber Council and a Senator in 1779. Though a leading representative of Russian conservatism and a proponent of the Russian Enlightenment movement, he is perhaps best know as an author. His 'History of Russia from the Earliest Times' was published between 1771 and 1791 in seven volumes. Shcherbatov's final work 'On the Corruption of Morals in Russia' was published in 1797 and contained a scathing attack on the contemporary social customs._

_At the age of nineteen Lomonosov obtained admission into the Slavic Greek Latin Academy in Moscow by pretending to be a son of a priest. A scholarship to the University of Saint Petersburg was later followed by studies abroad at the University of Marburg under the tutelage of German Enlightenment philosopher Christian Wolff. Lomonosov would go on to become an important Russian scientist in a variety of fields, but perhaps best known for discovering the atmosphere of Venus. He was appointed secretary of state in 1764 but dies only one year later._

In response Godunov decreed that the peasants were forbidden to leave the estates on which they were born (Ivan IV had passed a similar decree in 1581). The peasants had truly become serfs._

_Czar Alexis received a superficial education from his tutor Boris Ivanovich Morozov before acceding to the throne at the age of 16. Morozov, who was also Alexis' brother-in-law, initially took charge of state affairs, but in 1648 a popular uprising in Moscow forced Alexis to exile Morozov. Alexis bowed to the rebels' demands and convened a land assembly (zemski sobor), which in 1649 produced a new Russian code of laws (Sobornoye Ulozheniye), which legally defined serfdom._

_After the Pugachev revolt, Catherine realized that for her the people were more to be feared than pitied, and that, rather than freeing them, she must tighten their bonds. Before her accession to power, Catherine had planned to emancipate the serfs, on whom the economy of Russia was based. When confronted with the realities of power, Catherine saw very quickly that emancipation of the serfs would never be tolerated by the owners, whom she depended upon for support, and who would throw the country into disorder once they lost their own means of support. The fortune of a noble was evaluated not in lands but in the 'souls' he owned. Catherine instead turned her attention to organizing and strengthening a system that she herself had condemned as inhuman. She imposed serfdom on the Ukrainians who had until then been free. By distributing the crown lands to her favorites and ministers, she worsened the lot of the peasants, who had enjoyed certain autonomy. At the end of her reign, there was scarcely a free peasant left in Russia._

_Paul I, in an effort to strengthen the autocracy, reversed many of Catherine's policies - he reestablished centralized administrative agencies she had abolished in 1775, increased bureaucratic control in local government, and sought to impose limits on the authority of the nobles. While Catherine caused many ordinary Russians to be enslaved through serfdom, Paul was the first Russian czar to limit the work required of these unfortunate people. At Gatchina, Paul educated their children, lent them money, instituted a system of free medical care, gave them more land for their use, and upgraded agricultural technology. In short, he was a model landlord. When it came to Russia's most humble people, as both czar and grand duke, he sought to end their suffering and improve their lives. In this, he put into action the Enlightenment ideas parroted, but never followed unless it suited her, by his mother._

_Alexander abolished many barbarous and cruel punishments then practiced and in 1802 introduced a more orderly administration of government by the creation of eight ministries. He improved the condition of the serfs and promoted education, doubling the number of Russian universities by establishing those at Saint Petersburg, Kharkiv, and Kazan. Nevertheless, despite the humanitarian ideas inculcated in him by his tutor La Harpe and despite his own wish to make his people happy, Alexander lacked the energy necessary to carry out the most urgent reform, the full abolition of serfdom. The institution of serfdom was, in the Czar's own words, 'a degradation' that kept Russia in a disastrously backward state. But to liberate the serfs, who composed three-quarters of the population, would arouse the hostility of their noble masters._

_Recently returned from a tour through Europe, Princess Yekaterina Romanovna Vorontsova-Dashkova is a devoted and loyal friend to Catherine the Great. Though they were once estranged because of Yekaterina's scorn of the lovers Catherine chose as lovers who in her eyes disgraced the court, it is a more mature and forgiving Princess who has returned. During her tour, Yekaterina procured the entrée to the society of the learned in most of the capitals of Europe due to her literary and scientific reputation. This also gained her the appointment as Director of the Imperial Academy of Arts and Sciences in Russia, the first woman in the world to head a national academy of sciences. It was a failing institution that lacked prominence and intellectual respectability, something Yekaterina managed to restore in a critical time in the history of science. The transformation from natural philosophy practiced by gifted amateurs to a professional enterprise had just begun._

The small inheritance her father left her was used to employ tutors to further her education. Alexander Shishkov is her mentor and she is an honorary member of the 'Lovers of the Russian Word' and the 'Free Society of Lovers of Literature, Science, and the Arts'. As a woman, the membership for the 'Lovers of the Russian Word' does not allow her to discuss her works with the group in person, and her relationship with the other members is rather oppressive although helpful in advancing her literary career.

_The court was not open to women before Sophia entered \[Root.GetAdjective\] politics, which she did after the death of Alexis which brought her brother Feodor to the throne. He ruled under her thumb but as his health declined, so did her power as more people tried to take advantage of the sickly Tsar. At Feodor's death, Sophia[\[4\]](#cite_note-4) two brothers were crowned senior Tsar and junior Tsar, with her to govern in their place as Ivan had both physical and mental disabilities while Peter, only nine years old at the time, was deemed too young to properly rule $COUNTRY$. By attending Feodor's funeral she formally entered the political scene and planned to secure the throne for herself with the help of connections, allies and capable politicians such as Prince Vasily Galitzine which she deftly utilized. It caused quite a commotion as women were kept from involvement in politics but Sophia managed to secure the throne with the help of the Streltsy, a military troop, and the uprising they took part of after Feodor's death. During the time she spent at Feodor's side, Sophia has acquired a good education and a political savvy that convinced the nobles and patriarch of her capacities to rule $COUNTRY$. Though she haven't governed the country for long, Sophia has shown that if she takes the throne, she will rule with a firm and heavy fist. She has already started preparations to further the organization of the military and to create an institution of higher learning._

_Though her education had been imperfect and desultory, Elizaveta is a bright, vivacious and beautiful woman who speaks Italian, German and French fluently. This is worth noting, as her coup to take the \[Root.GetAdjective\] throne will be successful if we agree to let her rule. Anna Leopoldovna's regency for her infant Ivan VI has been marked by high taxes and economic problems, which has furthered Elizaveta's cause. The Russian guards regiments supports her and could be the determining force that compels us to anoint her ruler. She has promised to never sign death sentences but is not adverse to spill blood. With the words, 'Who do you want to serve? Me, the natural sovereign, or those who have stolen my inheritance?' the Preobrazhensky Regiment was convinced to join her. Hopefully she has inherited her father's genius for government, Elizaveta has already shown signs of keen judgment and diplomatic tact that remains us of Peter the Great. Aleksey Bestuzhev-Ryumin is rumored to become her new vice chancellor, a formidable diplomat, and she has expressed her dissatisfaction with the cabinet council system, wishing to reconstitute the senate as it had been under Peter the Great, with the chiefs of the departments of state attending. Under her rule, perhaps we can establish the University of Moscow and the Imperial Academy of Arts?_

_The obstinacy and cruelty of Anna of Russia can be explained by her upbringing, she was raised for the nunnery and grew up confined to a royal cult of domesticity which did not allow for her personality to develop properly. The \[Root.GetAdjective\] Supreme Privy Council has decided to publicly support her as our new ruler, hoping that she will become a figurehead or at least malleable enough to allow them to rule through her. A set of laws that will limit her powers is being drafted, prohibiting Anna to start war, call for peace, create new taxes, or promote individuals to high ranks. Nor will she be able to punish nobility without trial, grant estates or villages, promote anyone to court office, and she will not be able to spend the revenue generated by the state. Eight hundred noblemen have heard the rumors of Anna's possible ascent to the throne and have signed a petition that will urge her to continue to rule $COUNTRY$ in an autocratic style and to continue to carry out Peter the Great's political, social, and economic advances. We doubt that Anna will become a figurehead, nor will she be easy to control. She was brought to the \[Root.GetAdjective\] court early in life, making her well prepared to handle political structure. With the favor of the Imperial guards and the lesser nobility, Anna will get her way._

### ![Msg event.png](/images/4/4e/Msg_event.png)Ivan IV, the 'Terrible'

_The son of Vasily III and his second wife, Elena Glinskaya, Ivan IV has been crowned as Grand Prince of Muscovy at only the age of three as his father has perished from an inflammation on his leg. His early life has been shaped by neglect and offense from the plotting boyars. At the age of sixteen, Ivan has been crowned as the 'Tsar of All the Russians' and has solidified the official formation of the Russian Tsardom - a realm which has existed already de facto during the reign of his grandfather, Ivan III 'the Great'.  
  
Despite his title would suggest, Ivan's first years of reign are characterized by their peaceful reforms and modernization. The nature of his reign changed when Ivan was thought to be fatally ill and the boyars refused to swear allegiance to his infant son. Ever since, Ivan fostered a paranoid grudge against the boyars which eventually led to the Massacre of Novgorod.  
  
If he is designated as the heir to the Tsardom, many are sure that the Tsardom would achieve its greatest - even if it is at the cost of the one or other city._

_The son of Tsar Alexis and his wife, Natalya Naryshkina, Peter inherited the throne of Russia at the mere age of ten. As Peter was not the first in line of succession, his half sister Sophia started a coup with the support of disloyal streltsy against the young Tsar. Some of Peter's relatives and friends had been murdered during this incursion. At the age of seventeen, Peter overthrew the regency and co-ruled over Russia with his half-brother Ivan V. Only with the death of his mother, Peter truly started to exercise power as the sovereign of Russia.  
His reign was characterized by his many reforms which affected all parts of the Russian society. During his first years, the Tsar implemented several sweeping reforms aimed at modernizing Russia and bringing it closer to the Western European powers. As such, the court had a Western European inspired dress code while the military saw overhauling changes. As an enthusiast for ships ever since his young years, Peter founded the first official navy.  
  
Peter gained the nickname 'the Great' for his several government reforms and for the Tsardom's transformation into one of the leading Empires of Europe._

_Born in the off-branch house of the German Ascania, Sophie of Anhalt-Zerbst was one of many insignificant princesses of the Holy Roman Empire. At the age of ten, she met her future husband Peter III. After her marriage six years later, the young Sophie moved to Russia and learned the Russian language with great zeal. In order to adapt to her new environment and gaining the favor of the at that time reigning Empress Elizabeth, Sophie converted to Orthodoxy and changed her name to Catherine.  
The marriage with Peter III failed due to his immaturity and both partners committed infidelities. Catherine had plotted against her husband in secret for many years, and when Peter inherited the throne of Russia, the ambitious Catherine overthrew the Emperor after only six months of his rule.  
  
Russia experienced a renaissance of culture, arts, sciences and many other ideas of the Enlightenment during her reign. It was under Catherine when the Empire extended its reaches to the West considerably._

_The streltsy are the elite units of our army. They are recruited from the rural population and the available tradesmen and their service is lifelong. In times of peace, the streltsy are expected to return to their jobs. As such, any kind of campaign is undesired as it results in a loss of income.  
To counteract this, the idea of a secured salary has been suggested which would keep the streltsy loyal even during our most demanding wars._

### ![Msg event.png](/images/4/4e/Msg_event.png)The Red Terror

_Death to the enemies of the Revolution! The Revolutionary Guard, members of former serf families, have swept over the cities and have brought the frustration of past peasant generations. Countless rich burghers and boyars have been brought in front of a trial to judge their family's deeds during the time of the serfdom. Although called as a necessary evil against the enemies of the revolution, these trials have been more show than fair processes. Despite that, many burghers from peasant origins have joined the Revolutionary Guard in their quest to terrorize the great cities of \[Root.GetUsableName\]._

### ![Msg event.png](/images/4/4e/Msg_event.png)The Tatar Yoke

_The Tatar Yoke is a tributary system enforced on the Russians ever since the fall of the Kievan Rus' to the Mongol Horde in 1248. The Grand Principality has become the intermediary between the hordes and the Russian lands after Ivan I of Moscow has joined his overlords against a rebellion led by his rival and prince from Tver in 1327. The Mongols have granted our principality the right to govern the Rus' and collect their tributary in their name.  
  
Nowadays, this Tatar Yoke is on its last legs as the Golden Horde declined and splintered under its own weight. While \[Root.GetUsableName\] is de jure still a tributary state of the hordes, it is de facto \[Root.Monarch.GetTitle\] \[Root.Monarch.GetName\] who is ruling over Russia without the influence of the Tatar._

### ![Msg event.png](/images/4/4e/Msg_event.png)The Third Period of the Muscovite Civil War

_The reign of Vasily II is a troubled one. His grandfather, Dmitry Donskoy, has appointed Vasily I as his legal successor and Vasily I's brother, Yury Dmitrievich, as the next in the line of succession.  
Eventually, Dmitry and Vasily I have died and Vasily I's son, Vasily II, has become the ruler of \[Root.GetUsableName\]. This act is in direct defiance to the succession law of seniority and as such, Yury rebelled against the then still young Vasily II. This has led to the Muscovite Civil War between Vasily II versus Yury and his sons, Vasily Kosoy and Dmitry Shemyaka.  
  
While the threats of Kosoy and Yury were dealt with, Dmitry Shemyaka still poses a danger to the stability of the \[Root.GovernmentName\]. With a small army of conspirators, Dmitry executes a coup d'etat against Vasily II. The \[Root.Monarch.GetTitle\] gets captured, blinded and exiled to Uglich while Dmitry asserts control over the government._
