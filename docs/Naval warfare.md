Please help improve this article or section by [**expanding it**](https://eu4.paradoxwikis.com/index.php?title=Naval_warfare&action=edit) with: information about 'blockade force required' modifier in blockade section.

_This page deals with naval **combat mechanics**. For information on the recruitment and maintenance of navies see [navy](/Navy "Navy"). For details about ship types see [naval units](/Naval_units "Naval units"). For the state of war see [warfare](/Warfare "Warfare")._  

**Naval warfare** is the competition of sea-going power between nations at war. While a majority of warfare is land-based, the naval aspect of conflict can be incredibly influential in the spheres of trade, colonisation and conquest.

The _naval combat_ interface

Like [land warfare](/Land_warfare#Combat_sequence "Land warfare"), naval combat occurs when opposing [fleets](/Navy#Organization "Navy") confront each other in the same sea [province](/Province "Province"). Also like land battles, these sea battles can go on for many days, so they should be considered not as a single engagement, but as two fleets maneuvering to gain wind, standing off and skirmishing before the fleets finally collide.

In EU4, there is no player involvement inside combat, but the interface now displays more information, showing among other information which ship is fighting which. The naval combat interface shows the strength of the two fleets engaged in the combat. Combat will begin with a contest of firepower, followed by shock action in which ships attempt to grapple or ram one another. This sequence will alternate until one of the fleets loses morale and is either routed or destroyed. The condition of each ship (being the number of sailors still alive on that ship to fight) is expressed as a percentage, and hovering over a ship with the mouse cursor will produce a tooltip which identifies which opposing ship they are currently firing on, as well as their current morale, their strength, and the ship type.

Engagement width\[[edit](/index.php?title=Naval_warfare&veaction=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Engagement width") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Naval_warfare&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Engagement width")\]

[![Engagement width.png](/images/thumb/b/b7/Engagement_width.png/24px-Engagement_width.png)](/File:Engagement_width.png) Engagement width is the combat width for naval battles. Unlike the [combat width](/Combat_width "Combat width") of land warfare, the naval engagement width of the two participants are independent, that means one participant could have wider engagement width than the other. Heavy ships occupy 3 combat width, while galleys, transports and light ships each occupy 1 combat width. [\[1\]](#cite_note-1)

Engagement width has a base of 5.[\[2\]](#cite_note-2) It increases over time as diplomatic technology improves.

The conclusion to a naval engagement

Like land warfare, naval combat occurs when opposing fleets confront each other in the same sea province. Also like land battles, these sea battles can go on for many days, so they should be considered not as a single engagement, but as two fleets maneuvering to gain wind, standing off and skirmishing . A sea battle will last until one side is routed or annihilated. Patch 1.16 also introduced the concept of a naval combat width, and much like its land cousin it is the total number of ships that can engage the enemy at any one time.

### Engagement\[[edit](/index.php?title=Naval_warfare&veaction=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Engagement") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Naval_warfare&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Engagement")\]

While there is an ongoing naval battle, fleet's ship will try to populate its engagement width until the limit is reached, in the following order:

1.  Heavy ships
2.  Galleys
3.  Light ships
4.  Transports

Any ships already disengaged will be ignored, and galleys gain priority over heavy ships when battling in inland seas.

Importantly, any ships in excess of the engagement width are placed in reserve (until they replace those destroyed or disengaged) where they suffer morale damage although not in the fight. Therefore be sure to rather time adding smaller fresh and high morale reinforcements during each phase of the battle than merely throwing one full stack at the enemy.

### Phases\[[edit](/index.php?title=Naval_warfare&veaction=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Phases") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Naval_warfare&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Phases")\]

Combat is divided into a series of 3-day phases where the phases alternate between fire and shock, with the fire phase happening first. Therefore each 6 days (after a full cycle of fire and shock) it may be best to try and reinforce the engagement width line with fresh reinforcements as others have been lost or disengaged during these two phases. Staying in reserve in the backline causes severe morale reductions, even while not fighting. So timing reinforcements to match the phases is generally better than depending on ships in reserve.

### Target selection\[[edit](/index.php?title=Naval_warfare&veaction=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Target selection") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Naval_warfare&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Target selection")\]

Targeting, and specifically combined targeting, is why the "cannon:hull strength" ratio together with the relative combat width is so important in determining the outcome of a naval battle.

In combat each ship in the front line (all ships up to the engagement width) will try to find a target and make an attack. Every enemy ship has a base chance of 10 to be picked as a target, further modified by:

*   +0 to +5 random chance
*   +5 if same type (hence heavies are more likely to target other heavies, and galleys to target other galleys)
*   x0.1 if morale at 0 or less
*   x2 if hull strength is less than 50% (hence their appeal is doubled, resulting in many ships focusing fire or "ganging up" on the same weaker targets)

The enemy ship with the highest score is selected as a target. If the previous target is about to die, a new one will be targeted. This group focus on the weaker ones below 50% to push them to zero is why a battle can so quickly turn; normally as one runs out of reinforcements or ships in reserve and those still remaining in the fight have their morale collapse _en masse_.

Note that unless a ship disengages it may remain in the combat width line-up at near zero value, inhibiting a fresher high-strength ship to replace it in the combat width. This makes increases in disengagement chances very valuable.

The successful outcome of this combined targeting can be enhanced by your maximizing the number of cannons to target (from sending in higher quality ships - whether heavies or galleys, and from having a disproportionately higher engagement width than the enemy) as Cannons/Target Hull is the key factor in both the Final Damage and Morale Loss calculations.

### Die roll\[[edit](/index.php?title=Naval_warfare&veaction=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Die roll") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Naval_warfare&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Die roll")\]

At the beginning of each phase, each side rolls a die. The result is used to determine the morale damage and hull damage inflicted by that side during each of the three days of that phase. Some ideas and the wooden wall naval doctrines give a bonus to the die roll when fighting off an owned coast.

  

[![Naval combat bonus off owned coast](/images/thumb/d/d5/Naval_combat_bonus_off_owned_coast.png/24px-Naval_combat_bonus_off_owned_coast.png)](/Naval_warfare#Combat_sequence "Naval combat bonus off owned coast")

### Hull damage\[[edit](/index.php?title=Naval_warfare&veaction=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Hull damage") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Naval_warfare&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Hull damage")\]

Base damage is calculated according to the following formula:

![{\displaystyle BaseHullDamage=0.025+0.025\cdot (2+Dice+CombatModifiers)}](https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/png/6a4bfc748895900a0b9c2a6b8a7b14841970dcf3),

where Combat Modifiers include the Artillery Fire Modifier, Naval Doctrine Bonus (England) and Admiral pip value difference (between 0 to 6) for that phase of the battle. Ship Combat Ability and Admiral Combat Ability are modifiers applied in the Final Damage formula.

The amount of cannons of the attacking vessel affects the hull damage dealt and the hull strength (hull size) of the defender decides how long it can stand the cannon fire.

The _Artillery Fire Modifier_ gives a bonus or penalty to damage dealt depending on if attacker or defender has a technological advantage (with reference _not_ to its Diplomatic Tech, but rather to its Military Tech, and therefore to the relative difference between each side's artillery damage modifiers). For example, jumping from tech 21 to tech 22 relative to your enemy in fact means a cumulative artillery fire difference of **+2** (+4.4 vs. +2.4), which doubles this modifier.

*   Attacking unit modifier: The attack modifier from the attacking unit's technology, i.e. "Artillery Fire".

Artillery Fire Modifier = Attacker Artillery Fire - Target Artillery Fire

*   Attacking unit Combat Ability: Any Combat Ability bonuses the attacking unit has.

![{\displaystyle FinalDamage=0.03\cdot BaseHullDamage\cdot ShipStrength\cdot {\frac {Cannons}{TargetHull}}\cdot (1+0.05\cdot ArtilleryFireModifier)\cdot {\frac {1+ShipCombatAbility+CombatAbilityfromAdmiral}{1+TargetShipDurability}}}](https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/png/b723a44bc14f396b9dee350476f56432e455e3ad)

If target ship Morale is 0 or below, Final Damage is multiplied by 10.

Importantly, note that since Ship Durability is the denominator (and therefore affecting all the factors), one can drastically reduce the damage taken by having any modifiers that increase durability. For example, the 5% from the Corvettes Idea under Quality.

Galleys fighting in the inland sea have their Final Damage doubled. Which means that in inland seas, instead of fighting 3 galleys, one heavy is effectively fighting 6. Hence it's best to match galleys to galleys in inland seas and try and maximise your engagement width using a high pip manoeuvre admiral. Having a naval reformer advisor to boost morale will help too.

### Morale damage\[[edit](/index.php?title=Naval_warfare&veaction=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Morale damage") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Naval_warfare&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Morale damage")\]

Morale is damaged both over time during a battle and also when a friendly ship is sunk.

![{\displaystyle BaseMoraleDamage=0.25\cdot {\frac {CountryNavalMorale}{3}}\cdot BaseHullDamage\cdot ShipStrength\cdot {\frac {Cannons}{TargetHull}}\cdot (1+0.05\cdot ArtilleryFireModifier)\cdot (1+ShipCombatAbility+CombatAbilityfromAdmiral)}](https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/png/273f15a8838497d094b2c0743c75e1729e990137)

Several ideas decrease the amount of morale lost when a ship is sunk:

Any ship with less than 0.5 morale will try to disengage from the battle. Whether it will be successful depends on the ship's Disengagement Chance. The base value of this chance is 3% but can be modified by some national ideas.

### Unit pips\[[edit](/index.php?title=Naval_warfare&veaction=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Unit pips") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Naval_warfare&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Unit pips")\]

_Main article: [Naval units](/Naval_units "Naval units")_  

Each ship has stats in three categories: [![Hull.png](/images/thumb/8/8c/Hull.png/28px-Hull.png)](/Ship_hull "Ship hull") Hull, [![Icon ship cannons.png](/images/thumb/1/13/Icon_ship_cannons.png/28px-Icon_ship_cannons.png)](/Cannons "Cannons") Cannon, and [![Icon ship speed.png](/images/thumb/5/54/Icon_ship_speed.png/28px-Icon_ship_speed.png)](/Ship_speed "Ship speed") Speed.

Hull is the defensive stat, and cannons the offensive stat. With the exception of Morale, every combat phase the hull/cannon pips are used against each other to calculate the number of hull damage of each combat phase. Therefore, the damage sustained by the hull is directly proportional to the number of cannons firing at it.

### Leader pips\[[edit](/index.php?title=Naval_warfare&veaction=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Leader pips") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Naval_warfare&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Leader pips")\]

Leaders are rated on a scale of 0 to 6 for each of the following skills:

*   [![Naval leader fire.png](/images/thumb/4/41/Naval_leader_fire.png/28px-Naval_leader_fire.png)](/Naval_leader_fire "Naval leader fire") Fire, [![Naval leader shock.png](/images/thumb/4/45/Naval_leader_shock.png/28px-Naval_leader_shock.png)](/Naval_leader_shock "Naval leader shock") Shock

The leader's skill difference is added to the dice roll of its respective phases.

The conclusion to a naval engagement

### Concluding a battle\[[edit](/index.php?title=Naval_warfare&veaction=edit&section=18 "Edit section: Concluding a battle") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Naval_warfare&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: Concluding a battle")\]

A naval battle ends when one side is either:

*   Reduced to 0 morale; _or_
*   Flees from combat; _or_
*   Annihilated (stack wiped)

Upon victory, ships from the defeated fleet may be captured, depending on your chance to "capture enemy ship" (during a battle, hover your cursor over this percentage in the top right of the battle popup). Your capture chance is affected by selecting "ship boarding" as your naval doctrine (providing you a 33% chance of capturing a ship), ideas such as the "reconquista of the sea" of The Knights (15% chance), policies from Naval&Diplomatic (33%), and the relative maneuver skill difference between the admirals of the two fleets. Generally very few or no ships will be captured for leaderless (0 vs. 0 maneuver) battles.

If the defeated fleet still has ships remaining, it will escape to the nearest friendly port to repair and recover its morale. Naval battles, like land battles, may cause [war exhaustion](/War_exhaustion "War exhaustion") as well as affect [warscore](/Warscore "Warscore"), [naval tradition](/Naval_tradition "Naval tradition") and [prestige](/Prestige "Prestige"). Note that warscore gained from naval battles will generally be insignificant compared to those gained by its land counterparts.

In the event that more than one nation is on the winning side of a battle, the _largest fleet_ on that side will receive any captured ships.

Several ideas increase the chance of capturing ships after a battle:

### Morale\[[edit](/index.php?title=Naval_warfare&veaction=edit&section=20 "Edit section: Morale") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Naval_warfare&action=edit&section=20 "Edit section: Morale")\]

_"Morale of navies" redirects here. For bonuses that increase naval morale, see [§ Max naval morale](#Max_naval_morale) above._  

Morale is an important factor in fighting battles. Each turn of combat a unit will take a Morale hit. Once a fleet's average Morale value has been reduced to zero the fleet will attempt to retreat. Retreat cannot happen until both a fire and a shock phase have completed, so a fleet that has its morale reduced to 0 before that point will be destroyed.

If a fleet loses a battle while having low enough morale, they will be forced to retreat to a port of the nearest sea province. While retreating, it cannot be engaged in combat or be controlled until it reaches the sea province, nor will it repair. The fleet will also move 50% faster, and will recover morale at a normal rate during the retreat.

After every battle is fought a fleet must spend some time not fighting for its morale to recover.

### Morale recovery\[[edit](/index.php?title=Naval_warfare&veaction=edit&section=21 "Edit section: Morale recovery") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Naval_warfare&action=edit&section=21 "Edit section: Morale recovery")\]

Every month when docked at a home port, a ship recovers a 10% of its maximum morale.

Certain National Ideas, Idea groups and policies will increase naval morale recovery.

Unit strength is an important factor in fighting sea battles. Naval unit strength affects how long it can stand cannon fire before sinking. Each turn of combat a unit will take hull damage reducing its strength.

Galleys gain a bonus of 100% strength in inland seas[\[4\]](#cite_note-4) and a bonus of 50% strength in coastal sea tiles which are not in inland seas[\[5\]](#cite_note-5). The inland seas are shown below in pale blue, the coastal seas in blue and open seas in dark blue.

Fleets that have sustained damage will automatically repair up to their full strength when docked in an owned, allied, or in a province with fleet basing rights. There is a 'repair damaged' button that will detach damaged ships and send them to a nearby port to repair, when they are back up to full strength they will rejoin the fleet.

Costal Raiding is a naval ability which allows fleets belonging to nations with the Raid Coasts idea to raid the coasts of other nations for [![Gold Icon.png](/images/2/26/Gold_Icon.png)](/Ducats "Ducats")loot (ducats) and [![Sailors.png](/images/thumb/8/8f/Sailors.png/28px-Sailors.png)](/Sailors "Sailors")sailors.

Historically, this ability reflects the raids carried out by Barbary pirates which were active in the Mediterranean Sea during the mid-16th to early 19th centuries while in the case of the three Pirate Republics, it simulates the Golden Age of Piracy in the Caribbean Sea from the mid-16th to the early 18th century. [![Flag of So](/images/thumb/f/f5/So.png/20px-So.png)](/So "So") [So](/So "So") is a special case, as it represents a resurgence of the Japanese Wokou Pirates that raided the coasts of East Asia intermittently from the 4th century to the 17th century.

Raiding can provide a significant early-game boost to the income and sailor pools of nations that can do it and can also serve as a way to damage the economy of other nations. An example of this is [![Flag of So](/images/thumb/f/f5/So.png/20px-So.png)](/So "So") [So](/So "So"), which can employ Coastal Raiding against [![Flag of Ming](/images/thumb/a/a5/Ming.png/20px-Ming.png)](/Ming "Ming") [Ming](/Ming "Ming") to pile up devastation and cause Ming to potentially lose the [Mandate of Heaven](/Emperor_of_China "Emperor of China") and collapse.

Fleets will automatically blockade a coastal sea province under hostile control while they are stationary and have no other orders.

#### Blockade power\[[edit](/index.php?title=Naval_warfare&veaction=edit&section=30 "Edit section: Blockade power") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Naval_warfare&action=edit&section=30 "Edit section: Blockade power")\]

The blockade power (_sail speed_ in the tooltip) of a fleet is displayed after the [![Blockade enemy ports.png](/images/thumb/d/d6/Blockade_enemy_ports.png/28px-Blockade_enemy_ports.png)](/File:Blockade_enemy_ports.png) blockade icon in the fleet panel. It is mainly determined by the [![Icon ship speed.png](/images/thumb/5/54/Icon_ship_speed.png/28px-Icon_ship_speed.png)](/Ship_speed "Ship speed") tactical movement speed of the fleet's ships.

Blockades will only take effect if there is enough blockade power to match the full development. If a fleet does not have enough blockade power to blockade all adjacent provinces under hostile control, it will assign its blockade power in precedence of:

*   Hostile province under a siege lead by any friendly force
*   Hostile province with the lowest development
*   Hostile rebel province with the lowest development

The _detach blockade_ button ([![Detach blockade.png](/images/thumb/c/c5/Detach_blockade.png/24px-Detach_blockade.png)](/File:Detach_blockade.png)) in the [fleet](/Fleet "Fleet") panel will detach a fleet of sufficient size to blockade all enemy ports neighboring the sea province.

##### Blockade force required\[[edit](/index.php?title=Naval_warfare&veaction=edit&section=32 "Edit section: Blockade force required") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Naval_warfare&action=edit&section=32 "Edit section: Blockade force required")\]

In order to properly blockade a province with your fleet (i.e. inflict the effects of a blockade on the province), the blockade power has to be at least the development of the province. The "Coastal Defence" and "Naval Battery" increase the required blockade power according to their modifers. For example, if your coastal province has **20** development and you have a Naval Battery in the province, the enemy fleet will need to have a blockade power of **40** in order to give the full blockade effects to the province. In essence, the 'Blockade Force Required' modifier increases the threshold for blockade power to fully blockade the province.

Blockade force required is determined by:

A blockade has a number of effects on any neighbouring land provinces occupied by an enemy:

Notably, provinces producing [![Spices.png](/images/thumb/9/94/Spices.png/28px-Spices.png)](/Spices "Spices") Spices get negative monthly devastation that exactly counteracts the positive modifier from blockades.

Blockading a country's ports also applies the following modifier, scaled by proportion of (core, state) development blockaded:

*   **−75%** [![Trade steering.png](/images/thumb/b/b1/Trade_steering.png/28px-Trade_steering.png)](/Trade_steering "Trade steering") Trade Steering

Blockades have the following further effects:

*   [Siege](/Siege "Siege"): **−2** penalty to die rolls in non-blockaded coastal provinces, except those owned by primitives. (Provinces without ports, e.g. on the Caspian Sea, don't count.)
*   [War score](/War_score "War score"): Blockades are worth war score scaling with the proportion of development they represent and local autonomy. Capital and fortified provinces are worth more. Some [casus belli](/Casus_belli "Casus belli") have blockades as a war goal.
*   Spoils of War: Blockades add [![Gold Icon.png](/images/2/26/Gold_Icon.png)](/Ducats "Ducats") ducats to the blockader's treasury (listed under "Spoils of War") in proportion to the province's income.
*   Restriction of movement: See [§ Blocking a strait](#Blocking_a_strait) below.

### Blocking a strait\[[edit](/index.php?title=Naval_warfare&veaction=edit&section=34 "Edit section: Blocking a strait") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Naval_warfare&action=edit&section=34 "Edit section: Blocking a strait")\]

To block a strait the following requirements must be met:

*   The blockading alliance or a neutral nation have to control (owns or occupied) at least one side of the adjacent provinces
*   The blockading alliance have to control the sea by a naval force (blockade efficiency doesn't matter)

As a consequence, if a war alliance controls both sides of the strait they can march over regardless of blockades.

Examples:

*   A war participant controlling both sides of a strait: The Ottomans can cross the strait at Bosphorus as long as they have control of Constantinople and Kocaeli even when the enemy controls the sea. Same system applies for the second strait between Gelibolu and Biga.
*   A neutral nation controlling a side of a strait: Ulster, controlling Ulaidh, cannot cross the strait across the Irish Sea to Ayrshire in Scotland if Ulster is only at war with England (Scotland is neutral and gives military access to one of the war participants), and England controls the Irish Sea.
*   However, if Ulster has called in an ally, say Burgundy, and Burgundy is in a separate war with Scotland and controls Ayrshire, then the first requirement is no longer fulfilled, and the Irish nation can cross the strait despite England having control of the Irish Sea.

Besieging a province of a strait does not fulfil the first requirement; the siege must finish, translating to control.

Fleet missions are grouped together under a collective “Select Mission” button ([![Select mission.png](/images/thumb/8/8b/Select_mission.png/22px-Select_mission.png)](/File:Select_mission.png)) that allows the player to tell their fleets to;

*   Protect Trade
*   Privateer
*   Hunt Pirates
*   Explore
*   Hunt Enemy Fleets
*   Blockade Enemy Ports
*   Intercept enemy fleets

### Protect trade\[[edit](/index.php?title=Naval_warfare&veaction=edit&section=36 "Edit section: Protect trade") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Naval_warfare&action=edit&section=36 "Edit section: Protect trade")\]

[![Protect trade.png](/images/6/62/Protect_trade.png)](/File:Protect_trade.png)

This mission is available to any fleet that contains light ships. It will add the trade power of the light ships in the fleet to any maritime trade node that the player already has some trade power in, provided that the trade node is within both trade range and supply range.

The trade power of light ships depends on ship model, and increases as diplomatic technology advances. Furthermore, it scales linearly with the naval maintenance slider, reaching full potential at maximum naval maintenance, but suffering a **−75%** penalty at minimum naval maintenance. AI nations do not suffer a trade power penalty to light ships from low naval maintenance.

### Privateer \[[edit](/index.php?title=Naval_warfare&veaction=edit&section=37 "Edit section: Privateer") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Naval_warfare&action=edit&section=37 "Edit section: Privateer")\]

[![Privateer.png](/images/9/95/Privateer.png)](/File:Privateer.png)

This mission is available to any fleet that contains light ships. The fleet will hoist the Jolly Roger and add the trade power of its light ships to a pirate nation in any selected trade node. Unlike the protect trade mission, existing trade power is not needed in a trade node to start a privateer mission.

#### Privateer efficiency\[[edit](/index.php?title=Naval_warfare&veaction=edit&section=38 "Edit section: Privateer efficiency") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Naval_warfare&action=edit&section=38 "Edit section: Privateer efficiency")\]

Light ships on privateer missions receive a **+50%** bonus to their trade power. Privateers do not inherit any national bonuses or penalties to global trade power. Factors such as overextension or halved trade power when collecting in foreign nodes are notably ignored. The trade power of privateers is instead affected by various privateer efficiency modifiers:

#### Effects\[[edit](/index.php?title=Naval_warfare&veaction=edit&section=40 "Edit section: Effects") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Naval_warfare&action=edit&section=40 "Edit section: Effects")\]

The privateer fleet increases the trade power of a pirate nation that acts as a collector in the trade node. This pirate nation will submit **50%** of its earnings to the nations that commissioned the privateers contributing to its trade power. The presence of this pirate nation effectively reduces the share of trade value controlled by all non-pirate nations in the node. Income from privateering will be recorded in the economy window as _spoils of war_.

Any country that would have more than **20%** of the trade power in the node without privateers will receive a casus belli against any nation that has sent privateers to that node.

Any country that would have more than **10%** of the trade power in the node without privateers will have a **−1** opinion modifier per month of any nation that has sent privateers to that node, capped at **−100**.

Sending light ships on privateer missions against rivals is one of the easiest ways to acquire [power projection](/Power_projection "Power projection"). This can be especially useful to increase the power projection of the player beyond **+25** for **+1** free leader, or beyond **+50** for **+1**[![Administrative power.png](/images/e/ef/Administrative_power.png)](/Administrative_power "Administrative power") / **+1**[![Diplomatic power.png](/images/d/da/Diplomatic_power.png)](/Diplomatic_power "Diplomatic power") / **+1**[![Military power.png](/images/9/98/Military_power.png)](/Military_power "Military power") each month.

Activating a privateer mission will force the game to update a nation's power projection on the next game day. This will consequently update, among other things, the trade power in trade nodes and the nation's military force limits. Triggering an update like this can be useful when game stats are temporarily desynchronized due to certain actions, such as sending light ships to protect trade or changing local autonomy levels.)

Privateers also capture a portion of the ducats carried in [treasure fleets](/Treasure_fleet "Treasure fleet") passing through the node in which they operate.

Fleets containing [![Heavy ship.png](/images/thumb/5/50/Heavy_ship.png/28px-Heavy_ship.png)](/Heavy_ship "Heavy ship") heavy ships or [![Light ship.png](/images/thumb/c/cd/Light_ship.png/28px-Light_ship.png)](/Light_ship "Light ship") light ships may hunt pirates in any [trade node](/Trade_node "Trade node") which is not [![Inland node.png](/images/3/34/Inland_node.png)](/Trade_node "Trade node") inland; however, fleets containing only [![Galley.png](/images/thumb/3/3b/Galley.png/28px-Galley.png)](/Galley "Galley") galleys (as well as fleets which are a mixture of galleys and transports) can only hunt pirates in nodes where all nearby sea provinces are [inland seas](/Trade_nodes#Nodes "Trade nodes"), e.g. in Basra and Alexandria, but not in Hormuz. This does not necessarily mean that fleets will only hunt in inland sea provinces (where they are more effective): for instance, a fleet hunting pirates in Canton will use the Luzon Strait.

The total [![Icon ship cannons.png](/images/thumb/1/13/Icon_ship_cannons.png/28px-Icon_ship_cannons.png)](/Cannons "Cannons") number of guns of the ships is used to find the efficiency at which they hunt the pirates. The [![Trade power.png](/images/thumb/1/10/Trade_power.png/28px-Trade_power.png)](/Trade_power "Trade power") trade power of pirates is reduced by hunt pirate efficiency. This means that it reduces [![Privateer efficiency.png](/images/thumb/7/7a/Privateer_efficiency.png/28px-Privateer_efficiency.png)](/Privateer_efficiency "Privateer efficiency") privateering efficiency from 0%, when no fleet is hunting pirates, up to 99%, if the total number of guns from the hunting fleet is greater than or equal twice the total number of guns from pirating fleet. It is important to note that the reduction of privateering efficiency will not stop privateering fleets from stealing trade income if that fleet has any bonuses to its privateering efficiency.

In addition, it is helpful to know that this is also effective at stopping other nations from raiding your coasts.

Note that pirate fleets and fleets hunting pirates do not actually battle or otherwise damage each other, unless the countries that own the fleets are at war with one another.

Strategies and tactics\[[edit](/index.php?title=Naval_warfare&veaction=edit&section=46 "Edit section: Strategies and tactics") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Naval_warfare&action=edit&section=46 "Edit section: Strategies and tactics")\]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![Strategy](/images/thumb/a/a2/Years_of_separatism.png/36px-Years_of_separatism.png "Strategy") _The below is **one of many** player suggested strategies for **Naval warfare**. Bear in mind, due to the dynamic nature of the game, it may unfold differently for other players._

### Deployment\[[edit](/index.php?title=Naval_warfare&veaction=edit&section=47 "Edit section: Deployment") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Naval_warfare&action=edit&section=47 "Edit section: Deployment")\]

Decisive wins can be achieved in battle by concentrating all battle ships (heavies and galleys) in one fleet up to just a little over the engagement width, with a re-enforcement fleet in the neighbouring tile. Seek battle if one has superior naval assets, and avoid engagement otherwise.

When ready to attack detach and send only the front line (your best ships and flagship up to the value of your engagement width and a few more) into battle. Then as the phases progress feed reinforcements every few days from your neighbouring reinforcing fleet piece-meal into the battle to replace destroyed or disengaged ships. This will reduce morale losses from having as few ships as possible in the reserve line in the battle. One could call it the "just-in-time" re-enforcement method.

Remember to maximise your engagement width by using your highest manoeuvre admiral, preferably with high shock and fire pips too. You want more ships than the enemy to all be firing at the same time.

Naval admirals can significantly tilt a battle in one's favor, even more so than generals; without an admiral, stack wiping and sometimes even victory becomes unlikely even with a seemingly overwhelming advantage.

However, other factors may complicate this. A country may be forced to divide their fleet if they have naval objectives other than destruction or suppression of the enemy navy, such as protecting (multiple) trade nodes, transporting land units by sea, exploring, patrolling for pirates, reconnaissance, blockading and so forth. If the country lacks naval supremacy compared to their enemies, they may be forced to risk losses, support fewer of these objectives at the same time, or leave the sea entirely for the duration of the war.

However, even if you are weaker than the enemy, tactics may make the difference in a long drawn out war. Smartly engage one enemy stack at a time (using the techniques above) whenever the odds are materially in your favour to win that specific battle. A sequence of such victories can quickly add up to war score and help ensure the enemy cannot land their troops.

Be sure to sail your full stacks into ports where you have coastal forts with terrain penalties for the besiegers. The enemy will be lured into sieging these unfriendly forts if they don't see your stacks nearby, while having fleets allow you to sail into these coastal forts before they can withdraw. Such attacks can lead to quick stack wipes of the enemy and can dramatically turn the war in your favour.

### Bringing an enemy fleet to battle\[[edit](/index.php?title=Naval_warfare&veaction=edit&section=48 "Edit section: Bringing an enemy fleet to battle") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Naval_warfare&action=edit&section=48 "Edit section: Bringing an enemy fleet to battle")\]

A country with a naval advantage may wish to bring a reluctant enemy fleet to battle. This can be accomplished in several ways:

*   If the enemy fleet is docked at a port, they cannot be attacked directly. However, the fleet may be ejected by occupying (successfully sieging) that province, at which point the leaving fleet will enter into combat with any opposing fleet(s) in the corresponding sea province.
*   A small "bait" fleet may be used to lure the enemy into attacking, whereupon the main fleet can reinforce from a nearby sea province or port. This can also be used to lure fleets into or out of inland seas, where galleys have a relative advantage.
*   Light ships move faster than heavy ships / transports, which move faster than galleys. A fleet without galleys can easily catch an enemy fleet that contains galleys.
*   Putting your ships into port will usually cause the AI navy to be more aggressive and leave port, sometimes even attempting a full blockade, leaving their navy significantly more vulnerable.
*   After a defeat, an enemy navy will typically retreat to an adjacent port. Having an army already sieging down this port will give you a significant advantage, as the ships will be forced to leave port soon after arriving while having low morale and no repairs, allowing for a stackwipe or a victory in which they may lose most of their ships.
*   Sometimes a bug will allow the AI to remain permanently in a province even if it is sieged down. The only way to fix this is to retreat several sea tiles from the province and then go into port, or in other words give the ai an illusion of safety.
