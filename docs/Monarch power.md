Please help improve this article or section by [**expanding it**](https://eu4.paradoxwikis.com/index.php?title=Monarch_power&action=edit) with: a section about ‘all power costs’ modifier.

**Monarch power** is a measure of a ruler's influence and ability to govern their country with the help of advisors. It is a central mechanic in Europa Universalis IV, influencing how effective a country is at technological improvements, diplomatic relations, and infrastructure investments.

There are three types of monarch power:

*   [![Administrative power.png](/images/e/ef/Administrative_power.png)](/Administrative_power "Administrative power") **Administrative** power represents the internal organization and development of a country.
*   [![Diplomatic power.png](/images/d/da/Diplomatic_power.png)](/Diplomatic_power "Diplomatic power") **Diplomatic** power represents the external influence of a country, including diplomacy, naval power, trade, exploration or colonization.
*   [![Military power.png](/images/9/98/Military_power.png)](/Military_power "Military power") **Military** power represents innovations and leadership for armies.

This modifier changes the cost for every transaction involving monarch power.

Monarch power is generated at the beginning of each month. There are four sources of monarch power: _ruler, country, advisors,_ and _power projection_. Based on these factors, the monarch power gain of each type can range from 2 to 20 _(up to +6 from ruler, +5 from advisor, +2 from national focus, +1 from power projection, +1 from estate, +1 from alcheringa cult “The Rainbow Serpent” or from some sikh gurus, +1 from a custom nation national idea and +3 base value)_ a month.

By default a country can only store an amount of monarch power of each type equal to 999, increased by unembraced [Institutions](/Institutions "Institutions") and by [Corruption](/Corruption "Corruption").

### Advisors\[[edit](/index.php?title=Monarch_power&veaction=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Advisors") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Monarch_power&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Advisors")\]

A country can have an [advisor](/Advisor "Advisor") for each power type. Each advisor starts by providing 1–3 monarch points each month. An advisor's maintenance cost starts at 1 ducat a month for a +1 point advisor at the game's starting date. The cost increases quadratically with advisor skill level, and slowly inflates by 0.5% per game year. It is also modified by inflation.

[![Cradle of Civilization.png](/images/thumb/2/23/Cradle_of_Civilization.png/28px-Cradle_of_Civilization.png)](/Cradle_of_Civilization "Cradle of Civilization")

Available only with the [Cradle of Civilization](/Cradle_of_Civilization "Cradle of Civilization") DLC enabled.

Advisors can be promoted for 5 years' of their salary to increase their monarch point generation by +1 up to a max of 5 monarch points.

### Power projection\[[edit](/index.php?title=Monarch_power&veaction=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Power projection") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Monarch_power&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Power projection")\]

Having at least 50 [![Power projection.png](/images/8/8b/Power_projection.png)](/Power_projection "Power projection") [power projection](/Power_projection "Power projection") provides an extra +1 points a month for all monarch power types.

### Increasing monarch power\[[edit](/index.php?title=Monarch_power&veaction=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Increasing monarch power") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Monarch_power&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Increasing monarch power")\]

There are no percentage modifiers to monarch power, though there are effects that modify the cost of specific actions that require monarch power. The most flexible of these are advisor choices; a rich country could temporarily hire an appropriate advisor to get a discount on an immediate purchase.

Monarch power gains are much more independent of the size of a country than other resources such as monetary income and size of military, but large countries often require expending more power on additional provinces and military maneuvers. However, there are a few ways of increasing a country's monarch power, particularly if the country has some other resource to spare:

*   **Hiring more skilled advisors** increases monarch power production at the cost of [![Gold Icon.png](/images/2/26/Gold_Icon.png)](/Ducats "Ducats") ducats.
*   Many **random events** have an option to gain or lose monarch power. Often (but not always) this is offset with a corresponding loss or gain of some other resource.
*   **Republics** can re-elect leaders to gain skill in each category at the cost of [![Republican tradition.png](/images/e/ee/Republican_tradition.png)](/Republic_tradition "Republic tradition") republican tradition, or elect a different ruler for a different distribution of skills. With the tier 2 reform "Political Dynasties", one can elect a ruler with random skills that are worse than a monarch on average, but may be better than a normal starting republican ruler (requires [![Dharma.png](/images/thumb/f/fc/Dharma.png/22px-Dharma.png)](/Dharma "Dharma") Dharma DLC). Other types of government can try to manipulate the heir mechanics through random events, or in the extreme case, arranging for the death of an unwanted ruler or heir in combat.
*   Increasing and maintaining [![Power projection.png](/images/8/8b/Power_projection.png)](/Power_projection "Power projection") **power projection of at least 50** by maintaining and acting aggressively towards rivals provides a bonus, at the cost of long-running and often bloody feuds.
*   Most [estates](/Estates "Estates") can be granted **privileges** that increase monarch point generation at the cost of **−5%** loyalty equilibrium and **−10%** [crownland](/Crownland "Crownland"). Clergy estates or their equivalent grant **+1** administrative points, Burghers or their equivalent grant **+1** diplomatic points, and Nobles or their equivalent grant **+1** military points.

Available only with the [The Cossacks](/The_Cossacks "The Cossacks") DLC enabled.

*   [Steppe nomads](/Steppe_nomads "Steppe nomads") can gain monarch power by **[razing](/Razing "Razing")** non-core provinces, reducing its development. This gives **+25** power of the appropriate category for each point of development lost.

[![Rights of Man.png](/images/thumb/5/50/Rights_of_Man.png/28px-Rights_of_Man.png)](/Rights_of_Man "Rights of Man")

Available only with the [Rights of Man](/Rights_of_Man "Rights of Man") DLC enabled.

*   Great powers gain a diplomatic option called Influence Nation that allows them to pay one year's worth of income to grant +1 monarch power to a target independent non-great power nation in their weakest category for 10 years.
*   Monarchies can **abdicate** (in favour of a better heir) at the cost of [![Yearly prestige.png](/images/thumb/f/f3/Yearly_prestige.png/28px-Yearly_prestige.png)](/Prestige "Prestige") **50** prestige and 20 [![Legitimacy.png](/images/2/25/Legitimacy.png)](/Legitimacy "Legitimacy") legitimacy (requires [![Rights of Man.png](/images/thumb/5/50/Rights_of_Man.png/28px-Rights_of_Man.png)](/Rights_of_Man "Rights of Man") Rights of Man).

Available only with the [Cradle of Civilization](/Cradle_of_Civilization "Cradle of Civilization") DLC enabled.

*   **Promoting your advisors** increases monarch power production at the cost of [![Gold Icon.png](/images/2/26/Gold_Icon.png)](/Ducats "Ducats") ducats.

Some situations can cause a monthly loss of monarch points:

*   **Too many diplomatic relationships**: having treaties with more countries than a nation's diplomatic relations cap will result in a monthly loss of diplomatic power, equal to the numbers of relations above the limit. The number of diplomatic relation slots can be increased through selecting idea groups, national ideas, or other modifiers.
*   In the same way, having **too many military leaders** will also result in a monthly loss of military power, equal to the number of leaders above the limit. The number of military leaders without upkeep can be increased by ideas, traditions, and policies, by embracing [Feudalism](/Feudalism "Feudalism"), by increasing and maintaining power projection of at least 25, by increasing government rank to Empire with [![Common Sense.png](/images/thumb/e/e4/Common_Sense.png/28px-Common_Sense.png)](/Common_Sense "Common Sense") Common Sense DLC, and other factors.

### National focus\[[edit](/index.php?title=Monarch_power&veaction=edit&section=7 "Edit section: National focus") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Monarch_power&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: National focus")\]

[![Res Publica.png](/images/thumb/b/b5/Res_Publica.png/28px-Res_Publica.png)](/Res_Publica "Res Publica")[![Common Sense.png](/images/thumb/e/e4/Common_Sense.png/28px-Common_Sense.png)](/Common_Sense "Common Sense")

Available only with the [Res Publica](/Res_Publica "Res Publica") DLC _or_ the [Common Sense](/Common_Sense "Common Sense") DLC enabled.

Countries can set a national focus on any of the three monarch power types. The chosen monarch power type receives **+2** per month (added to the base gain), while other two monarch power types decrease by **−1** each month. A focus does not change the overall amount of monarch power generated per month, it merely redistributes it. How often the national focus can be removed or changed depends on the country's [Government rank](/Government_rank "Government rank"): Duchy = 25 years, Kingdom = 20 years, Empire = 15 years.

This allows a country to catch up faster if behind in a specific technology (especially with [![Military technology.png](/images/1/1a/Military_technology.png)](/Military_technology "Military technology") Military technology, which has a huge impact) or to fill out ideas more quickly. Always be aware of the country's ruler though, because they still play an important role. For example, the current ruler may have very good administrative skill, whereas the heir may be unbalanced and only have 1 or even 0 administrative skill. Due to this, and particularly since changing the national focus takes a long time, planning ahead is essential.

Monarch power cap\[[edit](/index.php?title=Monarch_power&veaction=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Monarch power cap") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Monarch_power&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Monarch power cap")\]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The amount of each type of monarch power that a country can have at a given time is limited by a cap. This cap is the same for all power types ([![Administrative power.png](/images/e/ef/Administrative_power.png)](/Administrative_power "Administrative power") Administrative, [![Diplomatic power.png](/images/d/da/Diplomatic_power.png)](/Diplomatic_power "Diplomatic power") Diplomatic and [![Military power.png](/images/9/98/Military_power.png)](/Military_power "Military power") Military). The default value for this cap is 999 power; however, not having embraced [![Institutions.png](/images/thumb/4/43/Institutions.png/22px-Institutions.png)](/Institutions "Institutions") [Institutions](/Institutions "Institutions") will increase the cap's value, to 999 × (100% + current tech penalty from institutions).
