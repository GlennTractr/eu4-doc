![The Paradox Wikis network](https://central.paradoxwikis.com/images/5/58/Paradox_Wikis.png "The Paradox Wikis network")

The Paradox Wikis network are dedicated to various games published by [Paradox Interactive](/Paradox "Paradox"). Their main purpose is to allow the community build a repository of game-related knowledge (aka _Community Wikis_), useful for both new and experienced players and for modders.

The wikis are administered by [SolSys](/User:SolSys "User:SolSys") with the help of a community volunteer team.

Wiki forum threads
------------------

All PDX wikis have dedicated forum threads on their game's sub-forum. Users can post in these threads to ask questions or collaborate with others.

These threads are monitored by the wiki moderation team so there's a high chance of them responding quickly (up to a day or two).

Moderators

[Moderator](/Special:ListGroupRights#Moderator "Special:ListGroupRights") is the highest level of power afforded to volunteers. They have the ability to block users, restrict editing of specific pages, roll back edits, delete pages, restore deleted pages, etc.

Half-ops

[Half-ops](/Special:ListGroupRights#Halfop "Special:ListGroupRights") serve as a middle-ground between moderators and regular users. They can't block users or restrict editing of pages, but they can do many of the other things moderators can.
