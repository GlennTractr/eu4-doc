This article is [timeless](/Category:Timeless "Category:Timeless") and should be accurate for any version of the game.

EU4 allows players to use a number of different **multiplayer** options and features. Multiplayer games have a different start screen than single player games.

One player's computer acts as the "host." Other players are "clients." Thus, if the "host" quits the game, crashes or becomes disconnected from the Internet, the entire game would be offline.

The game allows up to 256 players to participate in the same multiplayer game, but that limit is usually only tenable on a high-speed local area network (LAN). Paradox suggests games played over the Internet are likely to only support up to 12 players. Paradox does not recommend playing multiplayer through a dial-up modem.

You may need to check your firewall settings to permit allowing network traffic to reach your computer. Because of the wide range of firewalls and network connectivity issues, Paradox does not offer any support for troubleshooting connection issues.

Hosting a multiplayer game\[[edit](/index.php?title=Multiplayer&veaction=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Hosting a multiplayer game") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Multiplayer&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Hosting a multiplayer game")\]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The host must share their IP address with other players of the game, and thus, must be able to find such information on their computer. In the start screen, you will be offered a choice to play a "LAN" game or an "Internet" game. That will take you to a **Lobby** where you can wait for other players to join your game.

Joining a multiplayer game\[[edit](/index.php?title=Multiplayer&veaction=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Joining a multiplayer game") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Multiplayer&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Joining a multiplayer game")\]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The game automatically scans for LAN games and will show you those in the multiplayer start screen. However, to see Internet games, you will need to provide the IP address given to you by the game host.

### Hotjoining: getting into a multiplayer game\[[edit](/index.php?title=Multiplayer&veaction=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Hotjoining: getting into a multiplayer game") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Multiplayer&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Hotjoining: getting into a multiplayer game")\]

**Hotjoining** is the ability to get into a game already-in-progress. Since EU4 is a very long, involved game, players may need to cycle in-and-out of a continuing game. Mutiplayer games permit players to "hotjoin" at any time. Hotjoining players will pick up at whatever point the game is at. The player inherits whatever situation the [AI](/AI "AI") has created for the country. A host can cancel the hotjoin process and kick hotjoining players.

### Takeover: letting the AI pick up a country\[[edit](/index.php?title=Multiplayer&veaction=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Takeover: letting the AI pick up a country") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Multiplayer&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Takeover: letting the AI pick up a country")\]

If you need to leave a game, there's no need to worry. With AI **takeover**, the rest of the players can soldier on without you. However, if you do leave the game, and then return (through "hotjoining"), you may be surprised (or disappointed) with what the AI has accomplished in your absence! It does however remain passive for a full year, to allow you to get back to it.

Finding multiplayer games\[[edit](/index.php?title=Multiplayer&veaction=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Finding multiplayer games") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Multiplayer&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Finding multiplayer games")\]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Community Tab\[[edit](/index.php?title=Multiplayer&veaction=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Community Tab") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Multiplayer&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Community Tab")\]

Under the multiplayer interface, there is a **Community** tab, which allows players to promote and find multiplayer games available over the Internet.

### Multiplayer Forum\[[edit](/index.php?title=Multiplayer&veaction=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Multiplayer Forum") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Multiplayer&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Multiplayer Forum")\]

Paradox will provide a multiplayer subforum on the paradoxplaza.com forums once the game goes live.

Resolving Technical Issues\[[edit](/index.php?title=Multiplayer&veaction=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Resolving Technical Issues") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Multiplayer&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Resolving Technical Issues")\]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Different DLC\[[edit](/index.php?title=Multiplayer&veaction=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Different DLC") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Multiplayer&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Different DLC")\]

Multiplayer games share the host's [DLC](/DLC "DLC") (except cosmetic DLC such as music and unit packs). It doesn't matter what a particular person has, the host decides which dlcs will be used.

### Check the Checksum\[[edit](/index.php?title=Multiplayer&veaction=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Check the Checksum") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Multiplayer&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Check the Checksum")\]

In due time, there will be different versions of EU4 spread across the Internet. In order to play a multiplayer game, all players need to ensure they have the same version. Paradox provides a [checksum](/Checksum "Checksum") feature to ensure all players have the same base game.

Playing a multiplayer game\[[edit](/index.php?title=Multiplayer&veaction=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Playing a multiplayer game") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Multiplayer&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Playing a multiplayer game")\]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Pausing and speed\[[edit](/index.php?title=Multiplayer&veaction=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Pausing and speed") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Multiplayer&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Pausing and speed")\]

The space bar is disabled as a pause button in multiplayer, since it is used frequently while typing in chat. Instead, players must press the Pause key. If anyone other than the host pauses, the game remains paused for up to 30 seconds, after which anyone may unpause.

### Options\[[edit](/index.php?title=Multiplayer&veaction=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Options") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Multiplayer&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Options")\]

*   Prevent Nation Ruining: If this option is on, the following actions are prevented while a player is subject to a truce after losing a war:[\[1\]](#cite_note-1)
    *   Truce breaking
    *   Selling cores
    *   Manually taking loans
    *   Releasing vassals
    *   Creating client states in cored provinces
    *   Accepting demands of rebels with less than 50% progress
    *   Releasing colonial nations
    *   Giving money to other players

### Intelligence\[[edit](/index.php?title=Multiplayer&veaction=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Intelligence") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Multiplayer&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Intelligence")\]

In a multiplayer game, information on army and navy strengths is hidden from the war interface. The numbers are replaced with question marks.
