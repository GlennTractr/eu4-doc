Rulers of AI nations will have personalities that determine how they act. The particular personality assigned to each ruler is strongly correlated with the category of their highest skill, with administrative, diplomatic, and military skill leading to administrator, diplomat, and militaristic personalities respectively. Knowledge of this can help players predict the personality of an upcoming heir.

The ruler personality types are as follows:

*   [![Administrator](/images/2/27/Personality_icon_administrator.png)](/Personality "Administrator") **Administrator**: _They will seek to improve their economy by any means available, but are less prone towards war unless it furthers their trade interests._
*   [![Balanced personality](/images/e/eb/Personality_icon_balanced.png)](/Personality "Balanced personality") **Balanced**: _They will try to strike a balance between war, diplomacy and trade, and cannot be counted on to behave in any one particular way._
*   [![Colonialist](/images/8/8d/Personality_icon_colonialist.png)](/Personality "Colonialist") **Colonialist**: _Their interests lie in overseas expansion and they will prefer to maintain good relations with their neighbors at home._
*   [![Diplomat](/images/b/b4/Personality_icon_diplomat.png)](/Personality "Diplomat") **Diplomat**: _They will seek out powerful friends and attempt to expand diplomatically, but are far less likely to go to war unless they are reclaiming lost territory._

Diplomatic rulers will try to maintain good relations with neighbors, and their diplomats will be preoccupied with [improving relations](/Diplomacy#Improve_relations "Diplomacy") rather than [fabricating claims](/Diplomacy#Fabricate_claims "Diplomacy") on their neighbors. They will try to expand through [diplomatic vassalization](/Diplomacy#Offer_vassalization "Diplomacy") if possible, often breaking alliances with larger nations just to free up relation slots for that purpose. The strong desire for peace even gives them a much higher tolerance for other nations that hold their [core](/Core "Core") provinces. Alliances between great powers are frequently due to the actions of diplomatic rulers.

*   [![Militarist](/images/8/8c/Personality_icon_militarist.png)](/Personality "Militarist") **Militarist**: _They will seek to expand aggressively at the expense of their neighbors and are far more likely to go to war._

Militarist rulers will relentlessly fabricate claims on neighboring provinces and launch wars of conquest. They prefer to ally countries with strong militaries that can aid them in war. They are more likely to hold the [_wants your provinces_](/Relations "Relations") negative opinion on other nations, both in terms of the number of provinces desired and the magnitude of the negative opinion. Even when negotiating peace deals, they will be inclined to demand more from their opponents, and will frequently accumulate large amounts of [aggressive expansion](/Aggressive_expansion "Aggressive expansion") as a result of this.

Rulers, including heirs and consorts, gain character traits that grant bonuses or penalties as well as determine AI behavior. These traits can also influence events by adding trait specific options. Only the traits of the current ruler affect the nation.

The first trait is received upon reaching adulthood at the age of 15, the second after actively ruling for 10 years, and the third after ruling for an additional 15 years. A timer-chart shows the time left for the next trait to appear (if there is one).

**Notes:** A player can assign some traits while designing a custom nation without entirely fulfilling some of the minor prerequisites, thereby bypassing them.

### Positive traits\[[edit](/index.php?title=Personalities&veaction=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Positive traits") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Personalities&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Positive traits")\]
