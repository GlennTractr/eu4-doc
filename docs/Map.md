EU4's terrain map up close

The **map** (or **Main Map**) is the main "stage" of the game during play, and is what the player will be watching most often for ongoing developments and changes to the world. The map comprises most of the Earth, apart from the polar caps.

Map graphics\[[edit](/index.php?title=Map&veaction=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Map graphics") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Map&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Map graphics")\]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Graphically the map is very similar to Crusader Kings II's map, with some enhancements. Most importantly, the passing of the seasons is simulated: as the months progress snow will spread across the map and then recede as spring comes. Much of the map becomes greener in summer as plants bloom. These seasonal changes affect game play, for example in winter supply limits change for land forces, and some parts of the ocean freeze, making them impassible to ships.

### Sprites\[[edit](/index.php?title=Map&veaction=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Sprites") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Map&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Sprites")\]

_See also: [Downloadable content#Cosmetic packs](/Downloadable_content#Cosmetic_packs "Downloadable content")_  

_See also: [Unit models](/Unit_models "Unit models")_  

The map is populated with a wide variety of 3D models, or 'sprites', that represent various things:

*   Armies and navies
*   Trade vessels and wagons, which can be hovered-over for information on specific shipments
*   Culture-specifically designed cities, and their recruitment, construction and development progresses
*   Trees and other terrain:
    *   Coniferous trees
    *   Deciduous trees
    *   Tropical 'palm' trees
    *   Savanna 'scraggy' trees
    *   Volcanoes

  
The map also features unique, or location-specific sprites:

Some of which are geographically accurate wildlife:

*   Alligators/crocodiles in Africa, Florida, and South American jungles/marshlands
*   Bears in Scandinavia and Canada
*   Buffalo on the North American plains
*   Elephants in India and southern Africa
*   Giraffes in southern Africa
*   Llamas in South American mountains
*   Moose in Sweden and Russia
*   Kangaroos in Australia
*   Seals in South American coastal regions, Western Isles (Scotland), South Africa and Norway
*   Seagulls and eagles/vultures in various regions
*   Whales in the Western Pacific and North Atlantic
*   Zebras in Southern Africa
*   _and other unreported sightings_

In addition, there are also some nation-specific landmarks ([National Monuments I and II](/Downloadable_content#Cosmetic_packs "Downloadable content") DLCs):

*   Angkor Wat (Angkor)
*   Buddhas of Bamiyan (Bamyan)
*   Cologne Cathedral (Köln)
*   Forbidden City (Beijing)
*   Giza Pyramid Complex
*   Hagia Sophia (Constantinople)

*   Mount Fuji (Kai)
*   Notre Dame Cathedral (Paris)
*   Old Faithful geyser (Bannock/Apsáalooke)
*   Petra (Ma'an)
*   Saint Peter's Cathedral (Roma)
*   Stonehenge (Hampshire)
*   Tenochtitlan (Mexico)
*   The Kremlin (Moskava)
*   Tower of London (London)
*   Windmills in the Netherlands Region (Holland, Liege)
*   Himeji Castle (Harima)

### How to tell the owner of an army\[[edit](/index.php?title=Map&veaction=edit&section=3 "Edit section: How to tell the owner of an army") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Map&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: How to tell the owner of an army")\]

*   Green: Self
*   Blue: Subjects; War allies; Aligned rebels
*   Grey: Neutral, even for allies
*   Red: Rebels (Not aligned); Nations at war with self
    *   Clicking on a foreign army will open [diplomacy](/Diplomacy "Diplomacy") with the owner. Clicking on a rebel army will open the stability and expansion page.

Provinces\[[edit](/index.php?title=Map&veaction=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Provinces") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Map&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Provinces")\]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

_Main article: [Province](/Province "Province")_  

The land portion of the map is broken into [provinces](/Provinces "Provinces"). Some provinces border sea areas, and are considered coastal provinces. These permit building and basing ships and conducting ocean-going trade. They may also be blockaded, or invaded by fleet-transported troops. Other provinces are landlocked and cannot support ships; they are also safe from blockade or invasion from the sea.

### Regions and areas\[[edit](/index.php?title=Map&veaction=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Regions and areas") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Map&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Regions and areas")\]

_Main article: [Regions](/Regions "Regions")_  

Each province belongs only to one area, which belongs to one region and which itself belongs to one super-region (also referred to in-game as sub-continent). Besides being used as scope triggers for other mechanics the system is also used in the _Regional Naming_ mechanic. If a nation owns land which is disconnected from its capital, it will display the nation's name following the location's name (the name of the location depends on its size).

Terra Incognita\[[edit](/index.php?title=Map&veaction=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Terra Incognita") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Map&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Terra Incognita")\]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

_See also: [Colonization#Discovery](/Colonization#Discovery "Colonization")_  

Unexplored areas of the map are known as _Terra Incognita_ (from Latin, ‘unknown land’) and shown as blank, white patches.

Terra Incognita provinces must be explored before they can be traveled across. This can be done by an [army](/Army "Army") led by a [conquistador](/Conquistador "Conquistador") (land) or a [navy](/Navy "Navy") led by an [explorer](/Explorer "Explorer") (sea); units led by these two [military leaders](/Military_leaders "Military leaders") can traverse and reveal such provinces. Armies can walk into enemy terra incognita if they are at war, even without a conquistador. However, the same is not true of allied nations, even when at peace, as armies cannot walk through allied terra incognita. Ships sailing past terra incognita will often reveal it if they are led by an explorer. With the [El Dorado](/El_Dorado "El Dorado") DLC enabled naval exploration becomes semi-automatic and land exploration can also be done automatically if done in the new world using Search for the Seven Cities option (RotW land exploration still needs to be done manually).

Undiscovered land provinces have a chance per month to be discovered by owners of adjacent provinces - typically taking 3–5 years ([Russia](/Russia "Russia"), however, has an idea that makes this discovery instant). After a certain period of time, an exploratory nation's discoveries will be revealed to other nations. The time between discovery and spread of information is influenced by [culture](/Culture "Culture"). Generally, a nation that travels near an area often, is in the same culture/tech group as another nation or has good relations is more likely to discover the area.

### Random New World\[[edit](/index.php?title=Map&veaction=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Random New World") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Map&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Random New World")\]

_Main article: [Random New World](/Random_New_World "Random New World")_  

Random New World is an option that can be selected in the nation select screen. The option replaces everything west of the Azores and Iceland, and east of Eastern Siberia, Wake Island, and New Zealand with new landmasses. Players can chose to generate a New World similar to the existing one or one with fantasy "what if" elements in it. In addition, the RNW is highly moddable and allows players to share their own user-created tile-sets with each other.

Wasteland\[[edit](/index.php?title=Map&veaction=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Wasteland") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Map&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Wasteland")\]

Some parts of the world are simply too remote for the technology of this era to ever have reached them effectively, such as the glaciers of Greenland, the Himalayan plateau, the mountainous forests of New Guinea and the depths of the Sahara. Other wastelands, such as the Alps or Carpathian Mountains, exist for strategic reasons. These areas can still be discovered, but are known as Wastelands and cannot be colonized or traversed. They will also show up on the Main Map, so there won't be any holes in the world as the game progresses and the map expands. Once discovered wastelands will remain colored grey, unless the terrain in uncolonized video option is turned on. If the terrain in uncolonized option is on and a single nation owns over 50% of the provinces bordering a wasteland tile, the nation's color and name will also spread over the wasteland (this option can be turned on/off - on by default).

Fog of war\[[edit](/index.php?title=Map&veaction=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Fog of war") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Map&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Fog of war")\]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Generally it is only possible to see activities in one's own provinces, allies' and subjects' provinces, provinces directly bordering yours, and provinces containing or next to your troops (except [exiled](/Exile "Exile") troops) or ships. Docked ships will show you the province they're docked in and the adjacent sea zone. Beyond this it is not possible to see any unit movements or any province changes on the map. The map becomes shaded as if being shadowed by passing clouds (made more apparent due to the clouds moving shadows). This area is covered by what is known as the _Fog of War (FoW)_. At Diplomatic Tech level 30 the player unlocks the covert action to infiltrate a foreign nation's administration, which will lift the fog of war from that nation for a duration of 5 years. AI nations banded in war against a common foe have a "combined" line of sight for that nation ().

**Note:** FoW is very different from Terra Incognita. It is possible to send forces through provinces to see what is within the FoW without needing explorers or conquistadors.

Minimap\[[edit](/index.php?title=Map&veaction=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Minimap") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Map&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Minimap")\]

[EU IV](/Europa_Universalis_IV "Europa Universalis IV") Mini-map

The minimap is located at the bottom right of the screen. Clicking anywhere on this little map will jump to that location on the main map. The white box shows what part of the world is currently displayed on the main map. The buttons along the top of the minimap can be used to access different map-modes that change the view of the main map. On wartime allies' and the country's military units will glow **green dots** on the map, and enemy units will glow **red dots**, it is possible to disable this feature on the game settings.

The main map supports a number of different views, allowing players to see the world in specific ways. The player can customize different map-modes as primary-maps which can be easily accessed by clicking on them or with the keys Q to P (the top row of a QWERTY keyboard). The different map modes are categorized into four main map-tabs (blue buttons on the upper right side of the mini-map). To bind a map-mode as a primary map, right-click one of the desired positions (red buttons above the mini-map) and left-click the desired map-mode. Each primary-map can be set to bind further map-modes accessible by cycling said primary-map again (for example: press Q twice to get to its 2nd map-mode and so on).

**Note:** While it isn't noted below, most map-modes also show information regarding owner, terrain, fort level and fort ZoC.

### Advice and strategy\[[edit](/index.php?title=Map&veaction=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Advice and strategy") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Map&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Advice and strategy")\]

Because of the complexity of the game and the massive amount of information accessible to the player through various means, map modes being one of the primary ones, tailoring the selection of map modes, grouping them into manageable portions, and using the hotkeys to quickly retrieve relevant data can greatly affect player decision making and ease of play.

One method would be to put related modes on a single hotkey, for instance, placing _Simple Terrain_, _Fort Level_, _Supply Limit_, _Loot_, and _Devastation_ onto one hotkey so that any and all information about conducting warfare is available by repeatedly pressing the same key and cycling through the modes. Other groupings with this method could involve relations, economics, provincial stats, trade, and many others. Ensure that the preferred map mode for viewing the world (typically political) does not get buried in a large stack of related modes, but is easily accessible, either having its own key, or sharing the key with at most one other important mode.

A second method could be instead of grouping the modes in related stacks on one key, spreading them out. For instance, using the five modes listed above, placing one each on 'Q' through 'T' and when warfare is the most important consideration in gameplay, cycling each appropriate hotkey so that the 'warfare' modes are uppermost and selecting them is one key away, rather than cycling the same key repeatedly.
