-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

_Main articles: [Formation decisions](/Formation_decisions "Formation decisions"), [Formable countries](/Formable_countries "Formable countries")_  

Country formation decisions are kept on the pages of each formable country. All formable countries are listed below.

Forming a country through decision\[[edit](/index.php?title=Formable_countries&veaction=edit&section=T-1 "Edit section: ") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Formable_countries&action=edit&section=T-1 "Edit section: ")\]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Generally, a nation must meet the following requirements to form _most_ formables:

*   Target formable does _not_ exist
*   Current nation is not an [end-game tag](/Formable_countries#End-game_tags "Formable countries")
*   At peace
*   Is _not_ a non-tributary subject
*   Is _not_ a [Steppe Horde](/Steppe_Horde "Steppe Horde")
*   Own and core certain provinces (Some provinces can also be owned by non-tributary subjects)

And forming a country will have the following effects:

*   A new name and color; often some prestige, permanent claims and the _"Increased Centralization"_ modifier.
*   Most formable countries have unique [national ideas](/National_ideas "National ideas"). An event triggered by the formation decision gives a choice between switching ideas or keeping the existing set. Note that [custom nations](/Custom_nation "Custom nation") do not get the event this way.
*   Formation of a new country changes "historical rival" attitudes regarding other countries. For example, if Christian [![Flag of Ottomans](/images/thumb/8/89/Ottomans.png/20px-Ottomans.png)](/Ottomans "Ottomans") [Ottomans](/Ottomans "Ottomans") form [![Flag of Roman Empire](/images/thumb/4/4e/Roman_Empire.png/20px-Roman_Empire.png)](/Roman_Empire "Roman Empire") [Roman Empire](/Roman_Empire "Roman Empire"), they will no longer be historical rivals with [![Flag of Austria](/images/thumb/7/7f/Austria.png/20px-Austria.png)](/Austria "Austria") [Austria](/Austria "Austria"). This also applies inversely; if [![Flag of Burgundy](/images/thumb/b/b0/Burgundy.png/20px-Burgundy.png)](/Burgundy "Burgundy") [Burgundy](/Burgundy "Burgundy") form [![Flag of France](/images/thumb/d/de/France.png/20px-France.png)](/France "France") [France](/France "France"), they will become historical rivals with [![Flag of Austria](/images/thumb/7/7f/Austria.png/20px-Austria.png)](/Austria "Austria") [Austria](/Austria "Austria").
*   Forming another nation while being the [![Emperor of china icon.png](/images/thumb/2/25/Emperor_of_china_icon.png/28px-Emperor_of_china_icon.png)](/Emperor_of_China "Emperor of China") Emperor of China resets all reforms made as the previous nation. This is important to keep in mind if looking to form [![Flag of Qing](/images/thumb/9/95/Qing.png/20px-Qing.png)](/Qing "Qing") [Qing](/Qing "Qing") or [![Flag of Yuan](/images/thumb/a/a8/Yuan.png/20px-Yuan.png)](/Yuan "Yuan") [Yuan](/Yuan "Yuan").
*   Forming a country may require your [capital](/Capital "Capital") to be in a region, or it may move your capital. This may void your [trade company investments](/Trade_company#Trade_company_investments "Trade company"), and if you don't have a [main trade port](/Province#Main_trading_port "Province") it may move your home node.
*   Forming a country resets any expanded infrastructure done in any provinces. Centralized states remain centralized however.

Formable countries\[[edit](/index.php?title=Formable_countries&veaction=edit&section=T-2 "Edit section: ") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Formable_countries&action=edit&section=T-2 "Edit section: ")\]

_During the harsh years of oppression in Persia many left their ancestral homes to resettle abroad. The Qissa-i Sanjan tells us of those who took a long and arduous journey to settle in Gujarat and to lit new fires and start anew. Known for their industry these men and women have thrived in their new homeland. Our efforts to make Zoroastrianism the only majority religion within our borders will allow us to reunite with these foreign brothers and sisters._

### ![Execute decision.png](/images/6/6d/Execute_decision.png)Provoke Hanseatic Trade Conflict

_The Hansa have the pesky trait to be difficult to deal with. They compete with our trade dominance in the Baltic Sea, and their position within the Holy Roman Empire grants them protection from us._

However, the Emperor is only obliged to support the Hansa in a defensive war. By provoking the Hansa into attacking us we can ensure the dismantling of the Hanseatic League without having to wage war with the entirety of the Holy Roman Empire. All we need to do is to provoke the merchants of the Hansa...

_The gods are everywhere. They are the air we breathe; the earth we walk on. They are the axe we swing; the water we flow with._

Fortunately, our priests commune with gods, and allow our \[Root.Monarch.GetTitle\] to change their personal deity.
