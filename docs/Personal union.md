[![Personal union.png](/images/3/39/Personal_union.png)](/File:Personal_union.png)

A **personal union** is a form of diplomatic relationship where one monarch rules over two nations. It can be formed by having a royal marriage with a country whose monarch dies without an heir (usually of the same dynasty). It may also be formed by enforcing a claim through war or, in certain nations, through an event or decision. Once formed, it works similar to vassalage: the nation leading the union (the senior partner) gains the throne and puppets the nation who lost their monarch (the junior partner). Personal unions can only be formed over [Christian](/Christian "Christian") [monarchies](/Monarchies "Monarchies") ([Catholic](/Catholic "Catholic"), [Hussite](/Hussite "Hussite"), [Protestant](/Protestant "Protestant"), [Reformed](/Reformed "Reformed"), [Anglican](/Anglican "Anglican"), [Orthodox](/Orthodox "Orthodox"), and [Coptic](/Coptic "Coptic")).

Unlike other subject types, the junior partner in a personal union can have their own subjects. For example, forcing a union over Bohemia as Austria will not end their overlordship over their vassals in Silesia.

There are several ways in which a player can form a personal union, or fall subject to one.

### Personal union by event\[[edit](/index.php?title=Personal_union&veaction=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Personal union by event") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Personal_union&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Personal union by event")\]

Several countries in this game have the opportunity to form a personal union with another country through an [event](/Event "Event"). All events resulting in a personal union can only fire if the junior partner is AI controlled (e.g. if the player chooses Aragon, the “Iberian Wedding” event will make Castile the junior partner).

*   [Poland](/Poland "Poland") can form a personal union over [Lithuania](/Lithuania "Lithuania") through its “[Successor of Wladyslaw III](/Polish_events#Successor_of_Wladyslaw_III "Polish events")” event. This will result in Lithuania forming a personal union under Poland, and later enables the Polish decision to [form the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth](/Commonwealth#Form_Polish-Lithuanian_Commonwealth_.28Poland.29 "Commonwealth").
*   [Castile](/Castile "Castile") can form a personal union over [Aragon](/Aragon "Aragon") through its “[Iberian Wedding](/Spanish_events#The_Iberian_Wedding "Spanish events")” event. This will also make [Castile](/Castile "Castile") the senior partner in a personal union over [Naples](/Naples "Naples"), if they are in a personal union under Aragon at the time that the event fires. This enables Castile to later [form the Spanish nation diplomatically](/Spain#Form_Spanish_Nation_Diplomatically "Spain").
*   [Aragon](/Aragon "Aragon") can also form a personal union over [Castile](/Castile "Castile") through the Aragonese “[Iberian Wedding](/Aragonese_events#The_Iberian_Wedding "Aragonese events")” event if Aragon is controlled by a player. Aragon can later take a decision to inherit Castile and form Spain.
*   [Aragon](/Aragon "Aragon") can additionally form a personal union over [Navarra](/Navarra "Navarra") if their 1444 heir, Joan II, ascends to the throne while he still rules in Navarra. (They are the same person.)
*   [Spain](/Spain "Spain") can form a personal union over [Portugal](/Portugal "Portugal") through the “[Portuguese Crown](/Spanish_events#The_Portuguese_Crown "Spanish events")” event between 1550 and 1650, if Spain has a royal marriage with Portugal and the Portuguese opinion of Spain is at least **+150**. This event is very rare (MTTH is 2000 months).
*   [Naples](/Naples "Naples") can receive an event that allows it to be in a personal union under [France](/France "France").
*   [Brandenburg](/Brandenburg "Brandenburg") can get a personal union over [Prussia](/Prussia "Prussia") if Prussia is a vassal of Brandenburg or if Prussia's opinion of Brandenburg is at least **+100**. This event can still fire even if Prussia is a vassal of another country.
*   [Brandenburg](/Brandenburg "Brandenburg") can form a union over [Ansbach](/Ansbach "Ansbach") (and hence typically Bayreuth) if their initial 1444 heir Albrecht Achilles ascends the throne while the 1444 Ansbach monarch Albrecht Achilles II still reigns. (They are the same person.)
*   [Bohemia](/Bohemia "Bohemia") can get a personal Union over [Brandenburg](/Brandenburg "Brandenburg") and [Saxony](/Saxony "Saxony") via events after vassalizing them and completing the according missions. The necessary subjugation CBs are also provided by missions.
*   [England](/England "England") can declare war on [France](/France "France") with the Restoration of Union CB by the “[Surrender of Maine](/French_events#Surrender_of_Maine "French events")” event very early in the game (the final round of the Hundred Years' War).
*   [Hungary](/Hungary "Hungary") can choose to become a junior partner under [Austria](/Austria "Austria") via the “[Death of Ladislaus Postumus](/Hungarian_events#The_Death_of_Ladislaus_Postumus "Hungarian events")” event.
*   Any Christian country can get an event that can lead to a peaceful union with another Christian nation if both rulers are between 16 and 40 and the two nations involved neighbor each other, have a high enough opinion of each other, have no heirs, both rulers are of a different sex and are either of the same dynasty or in the same culture group. This event is quite rare (MTTH is 500 months) (cf. event chain “[A Political Marriage](/Dynastic_events#Event_chain:_A_Political_Marriage "Dynastic events")”).

### Personal union through diplomatic means\[[edit](/index.php?title=Personal_union&veaction=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Personal union through diplomatic means") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Personal_union&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Personal union through diplomatic means")\]

For two countries to form a personal union _diplomatically_ the following prerequisites need to be met:

*   The potential senior partner either
    *   shares the same dynasty with the target country (potential junior partner), or
    *   has a royal marriage with the target country, or
    *   has claimed the throne of the target country.
*   The target country has no [heir](/Heir "Heir").
*   The target country is not already a senior partner in a personal union.
*   The target country is at peace.

If the ruler of the target country then dies heirless, the target country is at peace, and there are countries that can become a potential senior partner to the target country, the target country will fall under a personal union. Take note that claiming a throne causes a **−100** [opinion](/Opinion "Opinion") malus with the target country, and a **−50** [opinion](/Opinion "Opinion") malus with all countries that the nation claiming the throne has a [royal marriage](/Royal_marriage "Royal marriage") with but gives some priority to being selected as the default senior partner for the union (see rules below).

#### Best Claimant\[[edit](/index.php?title=Personal_union&veaction=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Best Claimant") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Personal_union&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Best Claimant")\]

If there are multiple potential senior partners, then the following rules are used to decide the "best claimant":

*   There are two brackets of claimant countries. In order of highest priority to lowest they are:
    *   Countries that have used the [Claim Throne diplomatic action](/Diplomacy#Claim_throne "Diplomacy")
    *   Countries that are of the same dynasty or have a royal marriage
*   Within these brackets, the country with the highest [development](/Development "Development") (taking into account [local autonomy](/Local_autonomy "Local autonomy")) has priority. There is a yet unknown upper limit to the development comparison.
*   If two countries have reached the same development upper limit, then the first [nation ID](/Countries#List_of_tags "Countries") is used.

#### Succession Wars\[[edit](/index.php?title=Personal_union&veaction=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Succession Wars") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Personal_union&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Succession Wars")\]

When a country falls into a personal union under another country in such a manner, the game will identify another country among all countries that were considered as a potential senior partner, have rivaled the new senior partner, or have a [royal marriage](/Royal_marriage "Royal marriage") with the new senior partner. They will receive an event where they can either accept or decline to enter a succession war over the new junior partner. If no country is willing to contest the personal union, the target country will fall under a personal union under the new senior partner peacefully. If a succession war ensues, the attacker, if successful, can enforce a union over the junior partner, or demand that the senior partner release the target country. Note that the 'defender' of the war will have the junior partner on their side, as the game considers the war to dispute the union that has already formed.

#### Strategy\[[edit](/index.php?title=Personal_union&veaction=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Strategy") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Personal_union&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Strategy")\]

The player, in order to maximize their chances of becoming the senior partner in a personal union, will need to get their dynasty on as many countries' thrones as possible. A target country can adopt the player's dynasty if the target country's king dies without an heir or the target country is in an [interregnum](/Interregnum "Interregnum"); the target country will not fall under a personal union when the king dies, the target country has a high opinion of the player, and the player has higher prestige than the target country. The chances increase if the player has more than 4 royal marriages. The player can check this at any time by hovering over the target country's ruler's name; it says "A noble from X succeeds to the throne" if that is the case.

In order to further increase the chances of the player's dynasty spreading, they can target kingdoms with old rulers and no heirs specifically, ideally those that have few royal marriages. The player can check this at any time through the "Disputed Succession" alert.

Forming a personal union is not technically restricted to [kingdoms](/Kingdom "Kingdom") – [republics](/Republic "Republic") (notably [noble republics](/Noble_republic "Noble republic") and the [Dutch republic](/Dutch_republic "Dutch republic")) can also become the senior partner (but not the junior partner) in a personal union if all conditions are met. The player can check at any time if a target country is at danger of falling under a personal union by hovering over that country's king's name in the diplomatic view and checking the text after "On Monarch Death:". Countries that have no heir are listed in the "Disputed Succession" alert with a yellow font; such countries with the player's dynasty or a royal marriage are listed in green font. The player will receive a red alert themselves if they are in danger of becoming the junior partner in a personal union.

### Personal union through war\[[edit](/index.php?title=Personal_union&veaction=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Personal union through war") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Personal_union&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Personal union through war")\]

A country can form a personal union by attacking another country using either of three [casus belli](/Casus_belli "Casus belli"): Force Union, Claim on Throne, and Restoration of Union.

The Claim on Throne CB can be acquired by taking the [Claim Throne diplomatic action](/Diplomacy#Claim_throne "Diplomacy") if the target country shares the same dynasty, has either no [heir](/Heir "Heir") or an heir with a weak claim, and has a [royal marriage](/Royal_marriage "Royal marriage") with the country. If the country has acquired the CB in this way, the claim will expire if the target country obtains an heir with a strong or average claim, or the royal marriage used to obtain the CB ends for any reason. (Note that dissolving an alliance will cause a 5-year [truce](/Truce "Truce"), and, as you cannot cancel the royal marriage without losing the CB; declaring using the CB will cause the loss of at least [![Stability.png](/images/a/ae/Stability.png)](/Stability "Stability") **1** [stability](/Stability "Stability")).

The Restoration of Union CB is acquired by senior partners of a personal union if the junior partner breaks free (cf. [#Ending a personal union](#Ending_a_personal_union)) or through a country's mission tree (see [below](#Claim_on_Throne_or_Restoration_of_Union_casus_belli_through_missions)). A country can also acquire a Restoration of Union CB against a monarchy with which it has a royal marriage if that monarchy [introduces a new heir](/Ruler#Introduce_new_heir "Ruler").

In order to enforce the claim, the player needs to attack the target country using any of the casus belli above. While the target country is able to call in all its allies as this is a defensive war for them, some or all of the attacker's allies may be unwilling to join due to the opinion modifier "Does not want X in a personal union under Y". The [war goal](/War_goal "War goal") with either CB is to occupy the target country's [capital](/Capital "Capital"), and enforcing the union costs 84% (claim throne) / 60% (restoration of union) war score, regardless of size. This will cause [![Aggressive expansion impact.png](/images/thumb/c/ca/Aggressive_expansion_impact.png/28px-Aggressive_expansion_impact.png)](/Aggressive_expansion_impact "Aggressive expansion impact") [aggressive expansion](/Aggressive_expansion "Aggressive expansion") relative to the target country's size. Enforcing the union will also cause a **−100** [opinion](/Opinion "Opinion") modifier with the new subject (which is on top of the potential **−100** [opinion](/Opinion "Opinion") modifier caused by claiming their throne).

### Claim on Throne or Restoration of Union casus belli through missions\[[edit](/index.php?title=Personal_union&veaction=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Claim on Throne or Restoration of Union casus belli through missions") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Personal_union&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Claim on Throne or Restoration of Union casus belli through missions")\]

A personal union is similar to [vassalage](/Vassalage "Vassalage"). The senior partner controls the diplomacy of the junior partner, the junior partner will always join their wars and will always occupy provinces for the senior partner, as long as their liberty desire doesn't rise above 50%. The junior partner cannot declare war, negotiate separate peace treaties or enter [royal marriages](/Royal_marriage "Royal marriage"). As in vassalage, being the senior partner of an [elector](/Elector "Elector") in the [Holy Roman Empire](/Holy_Roman_Empire "Holy Roman Empire") will result in a **+50** point bonus to their electoral vote and a **−50** point malus from all non-controlled electors.

However, unlike a vassal, the senior partner does not receive any income from lesser partners in a personal union.

Ending a personal union \[[edit](/index.php?title=Personal_union&veaction=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Ending a personal union") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Personal_union&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Ending a personal union")\]

![Ambox outdated info.png](https://central.paradoxwikis.com/images/thumb/6/65/Ambox_outdated_info.png/22px-Ambox_outdated_info.png)

Please help with verifying or updating this section. It was last verified for [version](/Europa_Universalis_4_Wiki:Versioning "Europa Universalis 4 Wiki:Versioning") 1.30.

A personal union can end in any of the following ways:

*   Incorporation of the junior partner into the senior partner, by integration or inheritance
*   The junior partner declaring independence and winning the war
*   The ruler dying while the junior partner has a negative opinion of the overlord
*   Pretender rebels enforcing their demands in the junior partner
*   Rebels enforcing demands that change government type
*   Peacefully abandoning a PU with a lesser partner at the cost of:
    *   25 Prestige
    *   Truce of 5 years between the former overlord and the released country
    *   Opinion penalty linearly scaling with liberty desire from -200 to 0 for 0% to 100% liberty desire, respectively.

The following does not break a personal union

*   Religious rebels enforcing demands that change the state religion to a heathen religion (However it is not possible to integrate the junior partner anymore, unless they are also converted to the same religious group)
*   Changing religion to a heretic religion through rebels
*   Changing government type to a republic/theocracy through Decision
*   Ruler dying regardless of over 50% Liberty Desire
*   Going Revolutionary Republic while having PU

### Integration\[[edit](/index.php?title=Personal_union&veaction=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Integration") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Personal_union&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Integration")\]

A junior partner in a personal union can be diplomatically integrated by the senior partner through the **Integrate** option. Integration occupies a [![Diplomat.png](/images/thumb/e/ee/Diplomat.png/28px-Diplomat.png)](/Diplomat "Diplomat")[diplomat](/Diplomacy#diplomats "Diplomacy") until complete, and results in direct control of the former junior partner's territory and military, while also gaining control of its subject nations.

The requirements for initiating integration of a junior partner in a personal union are:

1.  Union has been stable for at least 50 years.
2.  Junior partner's opinion of senior partner is at least **190**.
3.  [Liberty desire](/Liberty_desire "Liberty desire") is less than 50%.
4.  Senior partner has more provinces than junior partner.
5.  Junior partner is at peace.
6.  Junior partner has control of its [![Capital.png](/images/thumb/6/6e/Capital.png/28px-Capital.png)](/Capital "Capital")[capital](/Capital "Capital").

Integration progress of junior partners appears in the diplomacy interface as a small vertical progress bar next to the personal union icon [![Personal union.png](/images/thumb/3/39/Personal_union.png/28px-Personal_union.png)](/Personal_union "Personal union"). If the integration process is cancelled before completion, all progress is lost, including the invested [![Diplomatic power.png](/images/d/da/Diplomatic_power.png)](/Diplomatic_power "Diplomatic power")diplomatic power. Diplomatic integration begins from 0 progress at this point. Unlike [![Vassal.png](/images/thumb/4/47/Vassal.png/28px-Vassal.png)](/Vassal "Vassal")[vassal annexation](/Vassal#Annexation "Vassal"), personal union integration can be cancelled if the personal union ends.

Integration will be paused if:

*   Junior partner [Liberty desire](/Liberty_desire "Liberty desire") is greater than **50%**.
*   Junior partner does not have control of its [![Capital.png](/images/thumb/6/6e/Capital.png/28px-Capital.png)](/Capital "Capital")[capital](/Capital "Capital").
*   At war and one or more of the junior partner's provinces are occupied by rebels or an enemy nation.

Integration will be immediately cancelled at the end of the month, if both countries are no longer members of the same religious group. This can be avoided by force-converting the Junior partner or changing the Senior partner's religion through rebels.

The total cost of integration is 8 [![Diplomatic power.png](/images/d/da/Diplomatic_power.png)](/Diplomatic_power "Diplomatic power") diplomatic power per [![Development.png](/images/thumb/a/a4/Development.png/28px-Development.png)](/Development "Development") development of the junior partner. This cost is increased by the [![Hostile core-creation cost on us.png](/images/thumb/9/93/Hostile_core-creation_cost_on_us.png/28px-Hostile_core-creation_cost_on_us.png)](/Hostile_core-creation_cost_on_us "Hostile core-creation cost on us")[hostile core-creation cost](/Hostile_core-creation_cost "Hostile core-creation cost") modifiers of the junior partner's corresponding provinces, and decreased by [![Administrative efficiency.png](/images/thumb/6/6e/Administrative_efficiency.png/28px-Administrative_efficiency.png)](/Administrative_efficiency "Administrative efficiency")[administrative efficiency](/Administrative_efficiency "Administrative efficiency") and modifiers that reduce [![Diplomatic annexation cost](/images/thumb/c/c5/Diplomatic_annexation_cost.png/28px-Diplomatic_annexation_cost.png)](/Diplomatic_annexation "Diplomatic annexation cost")annexation cost. These modifiers are displayed below:

The full formula for diplomatic integration cost is: ![\text{dip point cost} = \text{floor}\left( \sum_\text{per province}\left[ 8 \cdot \text{development} \cdot (1 - \text{administrative efficiency}) \cdot \left(1 + \sum\text{annexation cost modifiers}\right) \cdot \left(1 + \sum\text{local coring cost modifiers}\right) \right] \right)](https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/png/b01a57aad9a69441cceeb3275bcd46ab66476830)

The senior partner invests diplomatic power into the integration process each month at the following rate:

*   **+1** base rate
*   **+1** if same [religion](/Religion "Religion")
*   **+1** if in same [![Culture icon.png](/images/thumb/2/29/Culture_icon.png/28px-Culture_icon.png)](/Culture "Culture")[culture group](/Culture_group "Culture group")
*   **±1** per positive/negative point of [![Diplomatic reputation.png](/images/thumb/2/21/Diplomatic_reputation.png/28px-Diplomatic_reputation.png)](/Diplomatic_reputation "Diplomatic reputation")[diplomatic reputation](/Diplomatic_reputation "Diplomatic reputation").

If the total is **0** or **negative**, integration will pause, but not reverse.

Completing diplomatic integration of a junior partner results in the following effects:

*   **+5** prestige.
*   "Annexed Subjects" national modifier for 10 years giving **\-3** [![Diplomatic reputation.png](/images/thumb/2/21/Diplomatic_reputation.png/28px-Diplomatic_reputation.png)](/Diplomatic_reputation "Diplomatic reputation") [diplomatic reputation](/Diplomatic_reputation "Diplomatic reputation").
*   **−25** relations with other HRE members, if the junior partner was in the [Holy Roman Empire](/Holy_Roman_Empire "Holy Roman Empire").
*   Control of all the junior partner's provinces, army, and navy. This may put the senior partner over its [force limit](/Force_limit "Force limit").
*   Control of the junior partner's former [![Vassal.png](/images/thumb/4/47/Vassal.png/28px-Vassal.png)](/Vassal "Vassal")vassals, [![Subject colony icon.png](/images/thumb/d/de/Subject_colony_icon.png/28px-Subject_colony_icon.png)](/Colonial_nation "Colonial nation")[colonial nations](/Colonial_nation "Colonial nation"), and [![Icon protectorate.png](/images/thumb/5/55/Icon_protectorate.png/28px-Icon_protectorate.png)](/Protectorate "Protectorate")[protectorates](/Protectorate "Protectorate").
*   Cores on all the junior partner's core provinces.
*   **60%** [![Local autonomy.png](/images/thumb/1/17/Local_autonomy.png/28px-Local_autonomy.png)](/Local_autonomy "Local autonomy") [local autonomy](/Local_autonomy "Local autonomy") in all new cores (or their previous autonomy level, if above), and **0** if the senior partner already had a core.

### Inheritance\[[edit](/index.php?title=Personal_union&veaction=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Inheritance") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Personal_union&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Inheritance")\]

Inheritance instantly annexes the junior partner with no autonomy. Every time the ruler dies or abdicated, the junior partner(s) has a chance to be inherited. It can't happen if the union hasn't been stable for at least 50 years.

The probability of inheritance is:

*   **+1%** for each point of [![Stability.png](/images/a/ae/Stability.png)](/Stability "Stability")[Stability](/Stability "Stability")
*   **+5%** for each point of [![Diplomatic reputation.png](/images/thumb/2/21/Diplomatic_reputation.png/28px-Diplomatic_reputation.png)](/Diplomatic_reputation "Diplomatic reputation")[Diplomatic reputation](/Diplomatic_reputation "Diplomatic reputation")
*   **+5%** if in same [![Culture icon.png](/images/thumb/2/29/Culture_icon.png/28px-Culture_icon.png)](/Culture "Culture")[culture group](/Culture_group "Culture group")
*   **−1%** for each province of the junior partner

If the junior partner has too many provinces, the chance of inheriting it can be below 0% (meaning it will never be inherited). Such countries can only be integrated, or in some cases a special decision can be used to inherit the country.

If the senior partner of the union is in the HRE then inheriting an [elector of the HRE](/Elector "Elector") gives the electorate to the senior partner.

### Independence\[[edit](/index.php?title=Personal_union&veaction=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Independence") | [edit source](/index.php?title=Personal_union&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Independence")\]

If the senior partner's ruler dies while the junior partner has a negative [opinion](/Opinion "Opinion") of its overlord, the junior partner will become an independent nation again. Personal union is not ended when the regency is over and the heir becomes a ruler. The senior partner will get a "Restoration of Union" [casus belli](/Casus_belli "Casus belli"). A junior partner can also declare war on their senior partner at any time - even while the nations are in a war together - to gain their independence. If their liberty desire remains low, then they will never declare independence. Once the senior partner has a high enough development and strong enough army versus their personal union subject, they will never declare independence on their own, even at high liberty desire.

Note that [![Disloyal attitude](/images/1/1d/Attitude_disloyal.png)](/Attitude "Disloyal attitude") disloyal or [![Rebellious attitude](/images/6/64/Attitude_rebellious.png)](/Attitude "Rebellious attitude") rebellious subjects can accept [support independence](/Support_independence "Support independence") offers from other countries (typically the senior partner's [enemies](/Rival "Rival")), which will increase their [liberty desire](/Liberty_desire "Liberty desire") significantly and cause them to declare a war for their independence, where the goal is for the attacker to defend its capital.

Should the senior partner be fully annexed in a war, the junior partner will become independent.
