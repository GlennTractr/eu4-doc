The wiki uses a versioning system to facilitate keeping pages up to date, and to warn readers of info that may be obsolete.

Every regular page on the wiki has a version number associated with it, indicated using the `{{[version](/Template:Version "Template:Version")}}` template. This version number tells the readers and editors for what version the page as a whole was last verified. Any editor can update this if they've verified that all information on the page is up to date.

In addition, most pages include a version number for each section, indicated using the `{{[SVersion](/Template:SVersion "Template:SVersion")}}` template. Like the overall version number, this tells the readers and editors for what version the section was last verified. If the version is the latest, this version number is hidden, but if it isn't then a warning appears at the top of the section. Any editor can update this if they've verified that all information in the section is up to date.

Once every section of a page that is versioned by section is up to date, then the page as a whole should be marked as up to date.
